00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.504
We've come to the end of lesson two.

00:00:02.504 --> 00:00:04.169
It's been a long lesson,

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.085
but we have covered all of the major concepts in Webpack.

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:11.190
We've talked about the Entry point and how it

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.445
influences the dependency tree that Webpack creates for us.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:15.839
We've talked about Output,

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.620
and how we can edit and change the distribution folder and

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.685
where it is and what the distribution folder really does for us.

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:26.789
We've talked about loaders and plugins and the differences

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.030
between them and the things that they allow us to do with Webpack.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.840
We've talked about Mode and how we can set

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.170
the production and development configurations

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.130
with Webpack that make life so much easier for us as front end developers.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.895
We've talked about some tools to make Webpack convenient.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:46.820
There are a lot more out there but I think we've touched on some of

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.704
the major ones that will really save you some time when you're building your apps.

00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:57.379
Now, that's been a lot of configuration and it has a tendency to be a little bit tedious.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.330
But, in this next section we finally get to put our hands on some code and start building

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.000
web pages as we tackle SASS with

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.859
Webpack and some of the other technologies that would pack allows us to use.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
