00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
One of the most popular tools for making webpack

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.320
convenient to use is called the webpack-dev-server.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.470
I think it's one of the big reasons that webpack is popular,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.035
and I know that it's one of the things that makes

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.125
development really fast when you're using webpack.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:22.515
The webpack-dev-server allows you to create a server for development mode

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:29.085
only and it allows you to run files and run updates immediately.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:35.265
It's what allows Create React App to have that hot reloading feature which is so nice.

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:40.935
So first let's talk about what the webpack-dev-server is doing.

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.270
Right out of the box,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.295
the webpack provides the ability to watch certain files.

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:50.450
When we say watch, it just means that webpack is going to watch

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.995
the entire dependency tree to see when you make changes to those files.

00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:59.144
So if you're in your text editor and you save a file,

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:03.545
webpack can recognize that a change just happened on that file.

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:12.099
You can run this directly by adding a dash dash watch into the command.

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:15.569
When we add this dash dash watch into the file,

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:18.479
you can see that when we run the command,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.415
something different will happen.

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:23.490
A webpack never finishes running.

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:27.379
You can see here that it's just waiting for new files,

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.060
or it's waiting for something to happen.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.560
In fact, it's watching all of our files to see if something happens.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.620
So if we go back to our index.js file,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.825
and we add just another alert to see that something happened.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:46.920
Here, you can watch that webpack is noticing that something happened,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.825
and it's reasserting the compilation of all these files.

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:55.969
That's really cool, but it's still it's not quite as ergonomic

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.650
as some people would hope for and it can't just restart your browser.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.155
The big thing is that if I'm working with this and I have my local host setup

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:12.860
even if I save a file over here and webpack knows to rebuild my distribution folder,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.070
I still have to refresh my browser to see the change.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.905
So if we don't want to have to refresh our browser to see the change,

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:24.240
webpack has the webpack-dev-server,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.860
and that will allow the hot reloading feature that so many people love.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.395
To install the webpack-dev-server,

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:35.255
I'm going to stop the server,

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:40.719
and we're going to install the webpack-dev-server.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.724
Once that's finished loading,

00:02:43.724 --> 00:02:51.944
we can just add the webpack-dev-server to our command in our package.json file.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:55.574
So to edit the build-dev script,

00:02:55.574 --> 00:03:00.254
we're now just going to replace it with this,

00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:05.150
and the webpack-dev-server here tells webpack that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.430
we're going to use the dev server to run this webpack dev file,

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.025
and we're going to open it automatically every time we run it.

00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:18.300
So now, if we ran the npm build-dev script,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.160
we should see it open a new browser window for us with our app running.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:32.070
As you can see, we get our eye exist alerts from the index.js file, all of them.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.209
You can see that, none of our styles are showing up,

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.210
but that's actually expected because we haven't

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.540
set up any of our styles to be imported through webpack.

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:43.729
The only things that are showing up here are

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:48.125
the index HTML file and the JavaScript files that we've imported.

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:51.990
So it looks about like we would expect it to.
