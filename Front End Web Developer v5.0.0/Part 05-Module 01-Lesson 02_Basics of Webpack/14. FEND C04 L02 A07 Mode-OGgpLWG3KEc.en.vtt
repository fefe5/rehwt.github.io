00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.884
In webpack, there are two ways you can set the environment mode.

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:07.349
You can either do it through the CLI tool and in

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.934
your terminal or you can actually set that in the webpack.config.

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:15.765
If you need to run it through the terminal, that's totally fine.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.510
In this course we're going to teach you how to actually

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.660
embed it into your config because we're going to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.675
follow the webpack documentation and create

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:29.804
two different config files for our production and development modes.

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:32.505
Inside of your webpack config file,

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:39.304
you can add a mode flag by adding a mode attribute to the module exports.

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:41.149
You can have production here.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.100
You can put development here.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.480
Many professional apps are going to have more than two modes.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:52.819
So you'll probably have a testing mode and who knows what other modes but the cool thing

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.579
about webpack modes is that they're fairly flexible and you

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.670
can create them to be whatever you need them to be.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.480
Every app though has the option for development and production.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.979
So those are the two that we're going to stick with in this course.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.680
In your webpack file,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.865
you could create conditionals that check for a production or development mode.

00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:17.359
But that can get a little bit messy and you end up with a lot of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.334
logic that's similar but different and right on top of each other.

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:26.104
So in order to keep our webpack configs just a little bit cleaner,

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:30.109
we're going to go ahead and create a second webpack config file.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.810
So in the root of your project and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.814
exactly the same place as your current webpack config file is,

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:41.134
go ahead and make a new file and call it production.

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:45.305
So webpack.prod.js for instance.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.580
So now that we have this new web pack prod file,

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.390
we just need to rename our webpack config file to become the dev file.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.620
So in your text editor,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.859
just rename the file and I'm going to rename mine to be dev.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.659
For now I'm just going to copy the contents of my dev file into the prod file.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.009
We're going to totally change the production file eventually.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.349
But just so we can have something there that will

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.039
run the moment, we're going to keep that thing.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.674
So now that we have a dev and a prod file,

00:02:18.675 --> 00:02:21.410
we need to actually be able to run these.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:29.000
But currently our package.json has a very generic build command and instead,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.219
we need a build command that's going to reference the dev and prod files respectively.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:40.520
So what I'm going to do is replace this with some specialized scripts.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.330
We now have a build-prod and a build-dev and they

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.480
respectively go to webpack prod and prod.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.334
We need to change that to dev.

00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:58.625
So now that these two files are pointing to the correct files, there we go.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:02.990
Now that these two are pointing to the correct files we can run

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.325
them separately and that's really where webpack gives us a lot of flexibility,

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:10.879
is I can pretend to be in production mode and

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.329
all it takes is me just running a slightly different command which is awesome.
