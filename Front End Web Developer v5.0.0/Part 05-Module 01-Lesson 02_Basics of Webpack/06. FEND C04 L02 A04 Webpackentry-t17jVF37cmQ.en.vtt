00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.134
Let's get started with the web pack entry.

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:07.139
Web pack entry is the first major concept of web pack,

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.869
and what it's going to do is give us

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:14.399
a starting place for web pack to begin to build its dependency tree.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.039
So what we need to do is set up that entry point for web pack in our web pack config.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.144
In your application that you started with and cloned from GitHub.

00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:31.769
Right now, we have one web pack config file and in that web pack config file,

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.450
we are requiring a few things but really it's empty.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.710
That's great, but we need to actually start building on to this so that we can run it.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.594
Now, in our package.json,

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:51.439
you should see that you have web pack and web pack CLI both installed.

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.109
But what we need to do now,

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.710
is actually add an NPM script that allows us to run web pack.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.399
So I have added this here,

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.094
the build web pack and this is an NPM script.

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:10.534
You can write as many custom NPM scripts as you want.

00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:13.969
This one, is just going to run the web pack command.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.234
Now, we're going to add more to the actual command. Part of this later.

00:01:18.234 --> 00:01:20.834
But just for a very simple demonstration,

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.664
we're going to just run the word web pack.

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:26.365
I'm going to save that file,

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:31.774
and then we're also going to come back to our web pack config file,

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:35.125
and we're going to add an entry.

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:37.819
Now, web pack in Version 4,

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.029
has a default entry but this entry we're making

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.335
custom because we have a client folder that web pack,

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.334
the default doesn't plan for.

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:52.039
So we are declaring an index.js file inside of client,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.695
that is going to be the starting point where web pack will begin to build our tree from.

00:01:57.694 --> 00:02:01.125
So now that we have this entry point declared,

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:04.640
we can go and run web pack in the terminal.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.729
So I'm going to use my new NPM script and we'll run this build command.

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.444
When we do that,

00:02:14.444 --> 00:02:17.250
we find that we're getting an error, but in this case,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.794
the error is a good error,

00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:25.054
and we're getting this error because it can't resolve source in users video.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:28.490
Really, what this is telling us in a not-so-great way,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.450
is that the client index.js file doesn't exist and we need to create it.

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:42.769
So if we look at our source folder here,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.520
we're saying that inside of source and inside of client,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.555
there's going to be a new file called index.js.

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:54.795
Once we have that,

00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:58.819
we'll be able to run web pack and successfully see it built.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.984
So now, when we run the NPN build command,

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:04.860
we should see a different output.

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.629
We see that there's no longer an error.

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.224
Instead, we see this part,

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:13.655
this green part which is a really good sign.

00:03:13.655 --> 00:03:16.925
We see that a main.js file,

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:20.995
was created and that it is currently 0 bytes,

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:23.075
which is okay, we're still getting there.

00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:27.289
So this means that web pack was successful.

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:34.549
If we go back to our index.js file and we just want something to show up,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.920
we just want to see some JavaScript.

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.349
So I am going to do an alert and we

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.299
should see that reflected in our new built five.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.384
So when that runs,

00:03:50.383 --> 00:03:56.000
we can now see that the main.js file was created and that it is 17 bytes.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.525
Now, the really cool thing is that if we go back and look at our project structure,

00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:04.034
we see a new folder.

00:04:04.034 --> 00:04:07.784
This folder was not there when I started,

00:04:07.784 --> 00:04:09.055
I didn't create it,

00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:11.719
it's been generated by web pack.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.000
So when we open it and we take a look,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.529
we see that we have a main.js which is exactly what web pack

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.529
said that it built and if we take a look through it,

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.549
there's a ton of code here that we did not write.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.600
Everything in here, has been generated by a web pack and there's no real magic to it.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.235
But if we do a find for an alert,

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:42.050
you can see that my alert is right there.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.610
This is the piece of code that I put into index.js

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.230
and it's being created into our web pack bundle for us.
