00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.044
Let's get started setting up Webbpack.

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:07.469
I've created a GitHub repo that you can go to that has

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.774
all the things set up so that we have something to add Webbpack to.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:15.300
To give you a walk-through of what's here,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.080
we have a basic GitHub node and node app,

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.004
and it has Express as a web server.

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:29.629
Here, I've given you a basic read me that will help you install everything,

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.879
and I will have you install everything in this lesson.
