00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.419
So let's get started with Webpack.

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.679
First off, I want you to imagine a webpage,

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:09.990
a fairly normal webpage that you might be building.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.609
So let's say it looks something like this and it's just a normal run of the mill webpage.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.530
We've got some animations running,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.020
some animations that might be coming from

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.129
a JavaScript's third party cool animations library.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:27.329
There's tons of them out there.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.879
So something like that is going on.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:31.379
We've got some tooltips,

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.219
maybe coming from Bootstrap and using the Bootstrap tooltips or models

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.289
or something like that that requires the Bootstrap JavaScript library.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.789
We've got other interactions,

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.079
they may be custom,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.215
they may be coming from yet another library.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:48.830
You probably have something like a form or a calculator

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.640
or something like that that you're writing custom JavaScript for.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.929
On top of that,

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.269
to make our website extra cool,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.430
we've got some parallax going on.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.810
So we've got elements on the page that are scrolling at

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.329
different rates or maybe scrolling in from the sides as you go down the page.

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.724
Who knows what you've got going on?

00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:11.375
But whatever you have going on,

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:18.689
it's really cool and we are quickly accumulating libraries that we have to manage.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.789
So here, I've got a list of some of the files that you might

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.290
have already just building a fairly simple webpage like this.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.240
We've got Bootstrap, a fairly common library that is going to be on most webpages.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.069
But on top of Bootstrap,

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:40.009
we're using some of the Bootstrap JavaScript like models and tooltips.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.325
Then, we also have this animation library and

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:48.890
the animation library might have a dependency on another library.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.034
It might require jQuery or react or any number of things.

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:56.989
There's also the parallax library.

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:02.000
The parallax library might also have dependencies and you see how

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.129
we're beginning to really accumulate libraries that all have to be managed,

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.875
they have to load in a very specific order.

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:14.120
So this can get really difficult really quickly.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.000
I think from Lesson 1,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.319
hopefully you've got a good picture,

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.699
you've gotten to look at

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:24.064
some professional websites and how many assets there are and all of that.

00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:28.740
So when it comes to what Webpack actually does,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.775
we have here a lot of JavaScript files.

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:33.830
So let's say that these are all the files from

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.290
the previous slide along with any of the custom files that you've written.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:40.969
We also have all of your styles.

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.955
Styles that could be in the form of CSS or SaaS or if there's any of the others.

00:02:45.955 --> 00:02:49.985
We'll talk about those other formats later on in the course.

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:54.305
But here I can write my JavaScript in

00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:56.810
however many files I want and I can

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.754
write my styles in however many different files I like.

00:02:59.754 --> 00:03:03.574
Then, Webpack is going to run all of those files

00:03:03.574 --> 00:03:06.649
through some loaders and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.625
some plugins and we're going to talk about all of those processes later.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:14.689
Then, it's going to spit all of those out into a bundle.js file,

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:20.900
just one giant file that has everything we need in it already organized and it's great.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.530
So this is essentially what Webpack does.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.129
When I think about when do I need Webpack and when do I

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.125
not need Webpack and really what the benefit of it is,

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:36.650
I don't know about you, but sometimes I go to the grocery store

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.844
and I only have one or two items that I think I'm going to get.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:45.349
So I don't take a cart or anything like that and I just walk in and I grab items.

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.180
But then all of a sudden as I'm going through the store,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.075
I start accumulating more.

00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:52.294
I start grabbing things, "All this is on sale."

00:03:52.294 --> 00:03:57.619
So then I get to the end and I'm awkwardly carrying all of these things to the cashier

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.469
and I have to make a decision about whether I want

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.539
bags or whether I want to try and awkwardly carry everything to my car.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:08.310
Hopefully, like the bagger is going to put everything

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.620
into well organized bags and in this case,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.655
our assets are like all the things that we're buying.

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:16.459
You might only really need one or two things.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.399
So you might not need a build tool

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.549
that's going to put everything in nice organized bags for you like this.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.670
But clients never want you to simplify a website.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.905
As your website grows and as it gets older,

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:34.189
you're going to be adding things to it all the time.

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:37.795
No website stays exactly the same for a really long time.

00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:41.235
So when that's happening,

00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:44.090
you need a good way to manage website's assets,

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:48.049
not just at the moment that you're building the app,

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.639
but also for the future.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.724
So even if you think you're only going to use one or two assets,

00:04:53.725 --> 00:04:57.939
I would still lean towards adding a build tool,

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:02.230
adding Webpack so that you have a good way to manage those in the future.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.920
When we add Webpack,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.470
we're going to have some really easy bundled files to work with in the end.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.830
So to put it very simply,

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:15.169
what Webpack is allowing us to do is use all of

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.769
our assets the way that we want them in development,

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:21.590
but then have just one file added to

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:26.159
our website head and it makes it a whole lot easier to deal with.
