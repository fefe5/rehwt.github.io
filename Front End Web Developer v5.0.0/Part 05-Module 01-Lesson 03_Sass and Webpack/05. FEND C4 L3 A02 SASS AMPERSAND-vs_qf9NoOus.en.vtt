00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
In this video, I'm going to talk about

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.415
the Sass Ampersand and how you can use it to write some really cool Sass.

00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:08.910
Take a look at this piece of Sass.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.810
If this were normal Sass and you didn't have the Ampersand here,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.600
this would be talking about a parent element that

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.410
had an element of class section inside of it.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.135
But when you do put the Ampersand here,

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:28.245
you change it so that you're talking about a parent that also has a class of section.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.734
If you put it into CSS,

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:31.974
it would look like this,

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:36.965
where it is a parent and a section class on the same element.

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:39.650
Now, this might look a little bit

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.879
underwhelming until you think about its potentially uses.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.920
When you get this Ampersand,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.219
it gives you the ability to style something that is a parent and that's something you

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.409
never had in CSS before and it's one of

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.390
the truly unique Sass extensions that makes Sass so awesome.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.950
If you take a look at this,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.875
you'll see one of the more common implementations of the Ampersand in Sass.

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.465
Here, we have a button,

00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:11.150
it could just as easily be a link or something else and inside,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.900
we have nested all of the related styles.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.070
This is a really great way to organize your styles just because it keeps

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.269
all of them neatly encapsulated in one easily recognizable place.

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:26.719
But this would be a problem without the Ampersand.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.010
Because if I wanted to say that the button had a hover state,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.550
I would have to re-declare this button and its class below and add the hover state,

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.424
but in this case,

00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:40.939
with the Sass Ampersand,

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.539
I can declare extra properties on this parent just by using this Ampersand.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.560
So this is the same as me saying button.ctahover.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.349
When you use the Ampersand with pseudo selectors,

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.199
they become super powerful.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.590
Another really great place to use this is with animations.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.049
Once you master the Sass Ampersand,

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.949
you will be well on your way to writing much better Sass style sheets.
