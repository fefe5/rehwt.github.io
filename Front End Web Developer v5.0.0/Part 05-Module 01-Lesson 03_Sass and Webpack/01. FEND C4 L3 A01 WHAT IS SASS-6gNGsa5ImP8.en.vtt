In this video, I'm going to be talking to you about

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.000
Sass and why it's such an awesome front-end tool.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.785
The documentation calls itself a CSS extension language.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:12.554
That can be a little bit confusing,

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.265
but really what Sass is,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:20.039
is this awesome collection of extra syntax for CSS that will help you write better,

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.210
more concrete and efficient styles.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.469
So this is a really important thing to learn,

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:32.464
mostly because it's a really common tool in front-end development.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.250
At some point in your interviewing,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.409
you'll come across questions about Sass,

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.459
and I can guarantee you you'll come across Sass style sheets at some point.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.605
So they're really handy to learn.

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:48.444
It's a really powerful way to write better CSS syntax.

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:54.564
So let's talk about why we need Webpack in order to run CSS and Sass.

00:00:54.564 --> 00:01:01.250
We know that we've already used CSS on our browsers before and we never needed Webpack.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.840
So the question is,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.260
what's so different about Sass that now we need Webpack in order to run our styles?

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.050
It might seem a little bit strange until we realize

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.045
the structure of how the Internet works with our styles in our HTML.

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:19.799
We always start with the client.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.034
On the client or browser,

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:25.325
we can run HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:29.405
But when our client makes a request to our server,

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:33.000
if our server has Sass instead of CSS,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.390
it's going to try and send that Sass to the client,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.480
but the browser doesn't know what Sass is,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.070
we cannot have any Sass on this side of our application.

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.563
So when we're over here on the server,

00:01:47.563 --> 00:01:52.519
we can use Webpack to take the really awesome Sass files that we

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:58.054
make and turn them into CSS so that we can send the CSS back to the client.

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:02.780
That whole process is a really important thing to understand that whenever you're

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.780
using a pre-processed CSS library like less or Sass,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.814
they're really common in front-end development,

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:12.944
but you always need a build step.

00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:16.489
This is one of the major reasons that we even use build tools,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.004
Grunt and Gulp and Webpack are all really common for turning

00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:27.060
your Sass into CSS on the server side so that you can send it to the client.
