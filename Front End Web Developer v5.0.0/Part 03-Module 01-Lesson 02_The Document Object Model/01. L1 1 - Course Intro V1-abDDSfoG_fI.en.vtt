00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.515
So you built a number of web sites.

00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:05.064
You know HTML, which provides this structure for a site.

00:00:05.065 --> 00:00:08.855
You've used CSS to style sites and make them look good.

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:09.980
You've got it some nice font,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.859
a splash of color here.

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.094
You've also learned the greatest programming language in the world.

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:18.685
It's obviously JavaScript, but how did the worlds of

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:22.869
HTML and CSS and the world of JavaScript come together?

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.500
Well, that is exactly what you will be learning about in this course.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.829
HTML and CSS are fantastic at what they do.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.570
The problem is that they are kind of static.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.323
Once you write the HTML for a page,

00:00:34.323 --> 00:00:35.920
it does not change.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.070
That scintillating purple background color you added to the footer element,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.945
unless you change it in the style sheet,

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:43.480
it is always going to be that shade of purple.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.239
Static, it is kind of boring.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.950
We want change, we want motion,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.505
and we want to control them programmatically.

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:53.800
In this course, you will learn to use JavaScript and a new web

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.604
API called the DOM to control the website.

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:00.009
Being able to control the way a website responds to

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.859
its users is a fundamental skill of a web developer,

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.954
and you do not have to go very far on the web to see it in action either.

00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:09.950
An image slider, most kinds of form validation, a rating system,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.073
commenting system, all of these are powered by the skills you will learn,

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:15.994
but let me highlight just a few of them.

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:17.928
You will learn about the DOM,

00:01:17.927 --> 00:01:20.414
how to update and style page content.

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:21.970
You will learn about the hidden world of

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.084
browser events and how to hook into them and respond to them.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.219
You will also learn about the JavaScript event loop,

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.609
which will help you to write better, more performing code.

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.459
Now, why should I be teaching you about all of this?

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.799
I am Richard Kalehoff, a Senior Content Developer here at

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.619
Udacity and the Curriculum Lead for the front-end Nanodegree program.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.400
I have been developing on the web for,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.950
gosh, well over a decade.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.795
I have also taught this content for years at the graduate level,

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:49.795
and I actually use this stuff every single day.

00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:54.189
For example, there is a site I use all the time to watch some educational videos,

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.739
but the instructor talks way too slowly for me,

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:01.079
but there is no option or button to change the speed of the video.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.135
That is not a problem though. Using the skills in this course,

00:02:04.135 --> 00:02:07.750
I create my own button and I am able to alter the speed of the video.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.580
I can jump forward or backward in time.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.540
So, see, this skills are incredibly useful. Let's get started.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
