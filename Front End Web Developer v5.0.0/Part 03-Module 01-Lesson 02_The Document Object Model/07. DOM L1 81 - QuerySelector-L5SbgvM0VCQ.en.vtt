Let's select all of the H2 elements using the query selector method.

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:22.324
Passing just the elements name will let us select it with just the tag name.

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:24.519
Alternatively, we can select it by its class by

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.570
passing the name of the class with a period in the front.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.034
And both of these will actually return the exact same element.

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:34.149
One is selecting the element by the tag,

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.504
the other is selecting the element by its class,

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:40.000
but for both instances where using the query selector Method.
