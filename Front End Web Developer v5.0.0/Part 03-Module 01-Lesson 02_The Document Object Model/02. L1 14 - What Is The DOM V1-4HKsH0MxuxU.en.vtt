D O M stands for Document Object Model but it's commonly abbreviated to just "the DOM".

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:09.355
But, what is it exactly?

00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:12.015
Is it the set of clickable things in the Element pane?

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:14.900
Or is it the HTML that the browser displays?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.844
To understand what the DOM is,

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:21.669
it's helpful to know how we got from the HTML source to what we see in the browser.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.070
