00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.125
So, what exactly is a node?

00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:04.964
If you have any experience with object-oriented programming,

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:12.274
then Node with a capital N is like a class and node with a lowercase n is like an object.

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:14.324
If you don't know object-oriented programming and

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:17.204
all of that sounded like random words, don't worry.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:20.669
This might seem a little tricky at first, but stick with me.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.360
Capital N in Node is like the blueprint for a building.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.989
This blueprint can have the data about the building,

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.589
which we'll call properties.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.079
And it has a list of the building's capabilities,

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.299
which we'll call methods.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:36.547
Some properties might be the color of the building,

00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:38.160
the number of doors it has,

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:40.559
or the number of windows it has.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.160
Some methods might be an alarm system that's guarding

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:49.074
the house or the sprinkler system that's watering the grass.

00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:54.230
Now, let's say that this blueprint is a model for lots of real buildings.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.000
Another word we can use instead of blueprint is interface.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.119
An interface tells us the properties and

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.570
methods that are applied to the individual items.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810
Now, back to Node and nodes.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.609
Capital N Node is the blueprint or interface with the properties and methods.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:17.010
The lowercase n in nodes are the real objects built from the blueprint.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.885
Don't worry if this is all kind of hazy.

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:21.225
We'll be digging into this stuff a lot more.

00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:25.000
Actually, let's take a look at Node's properties and methods right now.
