00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
I've stored the "Our Amazing Community" heading,

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.139
this DOM element, into the heading variable.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:11.759
Now let's use the "classList" property to fiddle around with this DOM element.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.809
We can see that this DOM element has a class attribute with the class "text-center",

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.390
but we can have the "classList" property tell us that.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.030
Checking to see if the heading contains this class,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.710
this tells us it does.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.050
Let's add our own class.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.507
Using the "classList" property's "add" property,

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:39.640
we can say add the "ice cream" class,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.100
and we can see that it added it up here.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.185
Now we don't have any styling for the "ice cream" class,

00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:48.560
but it's still been added. Let's remove that.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.356
And calling "remove", and passing the class we want to remove,

00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:55.515
we can see it removed that "ice cream" class.

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:57.289
And last, but definitely not least,

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.509
is the "toggle method."

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.112
Toggling it once takes it off,

00:01:07.112 --> 00:01:10.629
and toggling it again puts it back on.
