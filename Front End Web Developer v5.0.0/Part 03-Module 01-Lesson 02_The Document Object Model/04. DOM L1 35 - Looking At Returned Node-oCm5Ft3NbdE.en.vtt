00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
I have this "GimmeNumber" function and all it does is return a number.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.799
Now if I call this function,

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.960
and store it in a variable,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.935
it runs, it returned 17 which gets stored in this variable and then I can just check it.

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:22.554
And we get the number 17.

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:32.950
Similarly, if I use document.getElementByID and select the main heading up here,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.969
that will actually return the element.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.895
And just like with number,

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:49.270
we can store this heading inside of a variable and then access that element later.
