00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
We can get the text of an element by using the textContent property.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.629
We can change the text of an element by setting the textContent property.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.420
Instead of just retrieving the text content,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.938
we've set that property here to this string,

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:23.969
and we can see that that text is appearing right over here.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.184
We can also check this in the Elements pane,

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:28.859
which we can see right here.
