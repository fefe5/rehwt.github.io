00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
I'm on MDN and looking at the "GetElementById" page.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.315
Now let's open up the console and use this method.

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:12.309
Let's switch to the elements pane real quickly and we're going

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.073
to search for this DOM element right here,

00:00:15.073 --> 00:00:17.375
the one that has the ID of content.

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:19.515
So, I'm going to hit the escape key to bring up

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.904
the console and I'll move this up just a bit.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:24.457
And now, let's just type out

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:32.000
document.getElementById and will pass it the string of "content."
