00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.785
Let's say we want to remove this card from the list.

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:06.320
We need to find this item in the DOM.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.050
So we can see that this div is this card right here and

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.089
this div parent is the div with the class of "hero underscore underscore module."

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.219
Let's store this div in a variable.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.539
Now we want this "cardContainer's" first child.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.945
So let's check out the "firstChild" property.

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:29.554
That seems a little odd,

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:31.390
shouldn't this be the div right here?

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.490
Let's dig into this.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.969
Opening this up and scrolling down and seeing "textContent,

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.850
" we see a bunch of arrows and some spaces.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.800
Now what is all that?

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:43.209
Let's go back up here.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.234
Give yourself some more space and edit this as HTML.

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:51.539
We can see that there are a bunch of "enters" and then some lines,

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.729
some "spaces" right here.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.319
So all of these "enters" and all of the "space" is this text,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.744
that's the" firstChild" of the "cardContainer."

00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:03.155
To get this div element,

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:08.635
we actually need to get the "firstElementChild" property.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:13.140
So we can see that this property is the div we actually want to remove.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.290
So let's now store this in a variable,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.170
and now we can remove this child card from its parent.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.340
We can see that invoking this function removed it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.640
from the page and it's removed from the DOM.
