00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
We've looked at the node interface and the element interface,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.304
but there are just so many more interfaces.

00:00:06.304 --> 00:00:10.084
Just think about the anchor element or a heading element,

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:14.070
each one of these is backed by its own interface with properties and methods.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.185
To see a list of all of these interfaces,

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:18.695
let's check out the web APIs page.

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:23.339
Now, we can scroll down a little bit over here and in the N category, we'll find node.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.559
And we can scroll down a bit more and on

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.304
the left-hand side of page we can find the element interface.

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:32.354
Let's take a look at this interface up here.

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:37.279
Where is HTML? Here we go.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.219
HTML element, let's look at this interface.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.414
Now, in this interface we can see that it inherits from element,

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:45.765
which inherits from node.

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:50.564
So every single HTML element will inherit these properties and methods.

00:00:50.564 --> 00:00:56.209
And this HTML element interface has its own properties and methods.

00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:01.292
Now going back to the list of all of them,

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:06.120
let's look at something specific like the anchor element right here.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.760
So the anchor element inherits from the HTML element.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.790
Going back, let's see is there a video?

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.070
There's got to be an HTML video tag.

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.500
Let's scroll to the bottom here.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.825
And here's HTML video element interface.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:23.469
And this inherits from HTML media element,

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.179
which inherits from the HTML element,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.240
which inherits from element and node.

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:30.729
And this HTML video element interface gives us

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.380
the properties and methods for every single video tag.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:37.879
So there are really a ton of

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:40.844
different interfaces with a lot of different properties and methods.

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:43.000
So, you should definitely check out this page.
