00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.845
Just like the note interface,

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:06.359
the Element interface contains a list of all of the properties and

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.970
a list of all of the methods available to an element.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.440
Let's check out some of the properties for

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.304
this element and go to right click on it and choose Inspect.

00:00:17.304 --> 00:00:19.405
Then I'll scroll down a bit here,

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:20.920
so that's in view,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.875
and I'll select the H2 element over here.

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:26.745
Pressing Escape brings up the console and

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:31.125
one little trick here is that if you selected an element in the elements pane,

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:35.734
$0 refers to that element.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.600
So this is the H2.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.715
$0 refers to the highlighted element.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:42.465
So if I select this and then say $0,

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:44.615
it will now be that span.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.910
So let's click on the heading, too.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:54.434
And let's check out these headings, class name attribute.

00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:55.975
We see class name over here.

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:57.925
Let's pick on that class name.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.824
And we can see that it has highlighted spanned,

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:04.230
which is have added span right up here.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.895
Now, let's pick another property to try out.

00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:10.640
Actually, let's move down to one of the methods.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.469
Let's look at this has attribute method.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.408
So we'll use $0, and again,

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:19.060
that refers to the element that we have selected in the elements pane.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.075
So right now, it's the H2.

00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:27.930
And we'll call hasAttribute, and we'll see.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140
Does it have a class, a name, or probably

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.650
it has all three of these, so let's just check one.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.895
I must just check class.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:36.000
So does this have a class?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.295
And it says it does.

00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:41.655
And again, this is the element interface,

00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:47.829
and every single method and property on this page is available to every single element.
