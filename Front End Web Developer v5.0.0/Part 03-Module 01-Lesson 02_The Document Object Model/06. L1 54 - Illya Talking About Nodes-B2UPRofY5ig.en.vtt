00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
For example, the text contained within

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.995
the angle brackets has special meaning in HTML and is sets to be a tag.

00:00:05.995 --> 00:00:08.099
As a result, whenever we encounter attack,

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.449
the browser emits token.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.734
In this case, it is the "StartTag:HTML" token.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:16.879
Next, we would get the "StartTag:head" token, and so on.

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:19.529
This entire process is done by the tokenizer.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.625
And while the tokenizer is doing this work,

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.660
there is another process that is consuming these tokens,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.240
and is converting them to node objects.
