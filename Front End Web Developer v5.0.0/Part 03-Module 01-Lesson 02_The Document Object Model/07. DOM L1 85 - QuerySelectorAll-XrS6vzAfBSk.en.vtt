00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.139
Let's use the "querySelectorAll" method to select all of the "h2" elements on the page.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.740
So running a "document.querySelectAll" and then passing an

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.844
"h2" will return a list of all of "h2" elements on the page.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:19.364
Now it's important to remember that this is not an array.

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:23.089
This is actually a special list called a "NodeList."

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.050
Because it's not actually an array,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.365
we can't use the array method ".map" to loop over the items in the array.

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:31.793
However, NodeList, let's look at it,

00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:34.880
does provide a, where is it here?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.330
"forEach" method and this "forEach" is very similar to the "forEach" of the array method.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.964
However, if we scroll down to the bottom here,

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:49.825
the browser support for the "forEach" method is not fully supported by every browser.

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:53.725
But that's all right. If we wanted to loop over our items in this list,

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:55.570
we can just use a "for loop."

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.920
First, let's store all of the returned elements in a variable.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.984
You don't want to watch me write a "for loop," so let me just paste it in some code.

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:11.650
So this will loop over every item in the "listOfElements" list.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.124
If we scroll back up here towards the top,

00:01:17.123 --> 00:01:21.000
we can see that the first item in the list is this heading right here.
