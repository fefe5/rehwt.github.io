00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
Now the web industry as a whole tries to stress the separation of concerns.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.605
HTML should be in the HTML file.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:09.794
Styling should be in a CSS file.

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:12.615
And interactivity should be in a JavaScript file.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:15.405
And it's best not to mix these together.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:20.254
So it might feel a little wrong to be putting your page styling in your JavaScript file.

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:22.625
And you know what, I totally agree.

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:25.355
Styles should be in a style sheet.

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:28.519
However we do have to tie these together just a little.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.414
For example, a class is added in your HTML,

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:33.679
which will apply styling to the element,

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.670
and we can search through the DOM to find a class using JavaScript.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.850
So instead of writing our styles in JavaScript let's

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.000
just have our JavaScript control the class attribute for an element.
