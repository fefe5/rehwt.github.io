00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
I'm on the documentation page for the Node interface,

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.370
and we can see down here are the properties.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.560
Let's just scroll down a bit.

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:09.959
Here are some of the properties of Node

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.089
and farther down on the page we can get to the methods.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.835
Let's scroll back up to the properties for just a second.

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:23.410
We can see that every Node has a ".baseURI" property,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.179
let's check that out on the body element.

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.359
Let's open up the console by going to "view", "developer",

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.820
and then "Javascript console",

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.512
so I can access the body by typing out "document.body".

00:00:38.512 --> 00:00:42.575
But actually let's store this in a variable.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:48.350
Now on "bodyElement", let's call the ".baseURI",

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:57.015
and we can see that this is the URI of the web page.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:01.759
Let's scroll down a bit and get to the Node types here.

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:08.670
So looking at "bodyElement.nodetype," gives us one.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.040
This tells us that it is an Element Node.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.000
So every node has the properties and methods listed on this page.
