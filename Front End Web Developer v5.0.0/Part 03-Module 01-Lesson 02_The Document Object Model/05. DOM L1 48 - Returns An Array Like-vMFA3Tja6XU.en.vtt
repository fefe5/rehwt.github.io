00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
I'm on the Document.getElementsByClassName page.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:06.059
And let's scroll down here just a bit.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:07.289
So, under these examples,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.720
we can see a couple of examples with some code,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.025
and let's look at one of them.

00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:15.500
We can see that it's a 'pre' tag with a number of different classes on it.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.195
But the one we're going to look at is line numbers.

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:19.859
So, here's a 'pre' tag with line numbers.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.629
Here is a 'pre' tag with line numbers.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:24.089
Here's one and here's another one.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.050
So, there are a number of items on this page with the class of line numbers.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.160
Let's use the getElementsByClassName to take a look at them.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.850
Invoking this function returns five items.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.200
Looking at this character right here,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.815
this bracket, makes it look like it's an array that's returned.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:45.149
But it's actually not.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.379
If we open this up,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.050
we can see that this is an HTML collection.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.589
And looking at the documentation up here, we can see that,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.109
here's the documentation for how to write it out and it returns elements.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.170
Elements is a live HTML collection of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.540
all of the elements that were found on the page with that class name.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.730
So, getElementsByClassName doesn't return an array,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.000
it returns an HTML collection.
