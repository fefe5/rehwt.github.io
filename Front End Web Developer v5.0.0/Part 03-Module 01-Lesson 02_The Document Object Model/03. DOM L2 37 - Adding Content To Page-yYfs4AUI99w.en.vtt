00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
I have used.createElement to create

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.564
a span element and store it in the newSpanElement variable.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:09.384
Then I have set its textContent to comma right now.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:13.410
Walking it out shows us that we have a span with comma right now as the text.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.050
Now the span element is not actually added anywhere to the current DOM.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.693
I want to add this text right after the learn ARKit text.

00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:26.618
So I need to select this DOM element and append this span.

00:00:26.618 --> 00:00:29.983
Now that I have selected the element,

00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:34.530
now I can just append the newSpanElement element.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:41.780
So appending this span to the heading shows the text right here on the page.
