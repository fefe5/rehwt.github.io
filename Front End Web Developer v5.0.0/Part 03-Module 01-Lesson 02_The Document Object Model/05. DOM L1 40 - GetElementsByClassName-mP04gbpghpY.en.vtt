00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.415
Let's look at this text right here,

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:07.205
and "right click" and choose "inspect" and then over here in the elements pane,

00:00:07.205 --> 00:00:11.544
we've got this H2 element with a class of highlighted spanned.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.789
Let's use the ".getElementsByClassName" method to select

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.405
all of the elements with the class highlighted spanned on the page.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:20.550
I'll press the "escape" key on my keyboard to open up

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.580
the console and I'll bring this down just a bit.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:31.289
And let's use "document.getElementsByClassName"

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.899
and then we'll search for the highlighted spanned.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.750
We can see here that a list of four,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.000
five items was returned.
