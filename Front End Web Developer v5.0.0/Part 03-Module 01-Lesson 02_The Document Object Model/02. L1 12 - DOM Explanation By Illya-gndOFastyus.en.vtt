00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
The HTML specification contains a set of rules

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.634
for how we should process the received data.

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:07.710
For example, the text contained within

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.669
the angle brackets has special meaning in HTML and is set to be a tag.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.574
As a result, whenever we encounter or a tag,

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:15.009
the browser emits a token.

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.922
In this case it is the StartTag HTML token.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:21.960
Next, we will get the StartTag head token and so on.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.178
This entire process is done by the tokenizer.

00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:27.120
And while tokenizer is doing this work,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.519
there is another process that is consuming

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.479
these tokens and is converting them to node objects.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:39.144
For example, we convert the first HTML token and create the HTML node.

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:42.630
Then we consume the next token and create the head node.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.367
Is there a relationship between the nodes?

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:49.294
Yes. Notice that the tokenizer emits start and end tokens,

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:51.490
which tells us the relationship between the nodes.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.150
The StartTag head token comes before EndTag HTML token,

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.554
which tells us that the head token is a child of HTML.

00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:06.920
Similarly, the meta and link nodes are children of the head node and so on.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.340
Eventually, once we consume all of the tokens,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.314
we arrive at the Document Object Model or simply DOM,

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:15.780
which is a tree structure that captures the content and properties

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.439
of the HTML and all the relationships between the nodes.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.974
Note that these objects contain all of their properties.

00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:25.724
For example, the image node has a source attribute

00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:31.477
and this node right here would also have the same property.

00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:35.399
The DOM is the full parse representation of the HTML markup.
