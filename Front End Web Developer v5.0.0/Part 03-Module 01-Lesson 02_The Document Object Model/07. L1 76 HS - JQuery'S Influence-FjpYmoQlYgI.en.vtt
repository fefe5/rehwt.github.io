00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
One of the main purposes of the jQuery library was

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.980
to abstract the way the differences between different browsers.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.080
As a developer, you'd write jQuery specific methods and then jQuery

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.000
would determine which browser it was running in and use the right code for that browser.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.769
Now because jQuery made it so easy to write code that ran correctly in multiple browsers,

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.004
it skyrocketed in popularity.

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.574
Since every browser tries to support the official standards now,

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:31.384
jQuery's uses gradually diminished and been replaced by native DOM methods.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:33.880
However, out of jQuery's popularity,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.820
new DOM methods were created.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's take a look at some of these new methods.
