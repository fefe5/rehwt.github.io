You learned quite a bit about the Web.

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:05.642
You learned about the DOM,

00:00:05.642 --> 00:00:10.589
how it's constructed, how to select by ID, class and tag.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.974
And you learned about the Node interface and the Element interface.

00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:15.279
In the next lesson,

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.919
