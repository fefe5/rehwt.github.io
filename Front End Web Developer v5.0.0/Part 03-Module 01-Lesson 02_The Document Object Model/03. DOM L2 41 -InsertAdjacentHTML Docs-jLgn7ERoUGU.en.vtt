00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
This is the "insertAdjacentHTML" documentation page.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.995
If I scroll down just a bit,

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:09.390
we can see that this method needs to be called on a parent element.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.850
This method also needs to be called with two arguments,

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.859
the position, and the text.

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.469
Now, it's important to realize that this is actually text.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:18.919
Similar to the text content property,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.875
this has to be text and not HTML.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:24.690
If you pass HTML, then that HTML will actually be displayed.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.855
Now this position property,

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:29.658
it's easier to see when we look at where they go.

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:34.950
These are the four items right here: "beforebegin",

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.630
"afterbegin", "beforeend", and "afterend".

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.685
But let's actually just check out the visualization down here.

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:45.304
So, if the element in question is this paragraph tank,

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:47.549
these are where the four positions go.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.454
"beforebegin" will appear before the element.

00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:52.814
"afterbegin" will appear right after it,

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:54.239
as the first child.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.179
"beforeend" will appear right before the closing tag,

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.045
as its last child.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:03.030
And then, "afterend" will appear right after the paragraph element, as a sibling.
