00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Here's a really quick thing I want to show you.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.835
I've selected this heading stored it in the community heading variable,

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:08.935
and modified its font size and color properties.

00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:12.165
Let's save this file and then see what that looks like.

00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:16.140
So if I scroll down here and refresh the page,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.480
we can see that this is what the heading would look like after reloading the page.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.423
And I can right click this and choose inspect element,

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:28.869
and I can see that it's added the font size and the color properties.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.905
I can see those styles applied here too.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:35.923
Now, let's go back to the code editor and let's switch over to the index file.

00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:40.840
Now the javascript file is all the way at the bottom.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.763
Let me just move this up a bit.

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:46.429
So we can see this here,

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.094
out of 1206 lines of code,

00:00:49.094 --> 00:00:50.759
this is it, 1203,

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.625
here's the javascript file.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:58.420
Now, let's actually cut this for a second and move it up to the head.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.689
So let me save this file and reload the browser.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.584
Here we are in the browser, now let's reload.

00:01:09.584 --> 00:01:13.214
We can see that our heading is what it used to be,

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:17.145
the original way, it hasn't been modified by the javascript at all.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:21.224
And we can see in our div tools that we have an error,

00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:24.949
uncaught type error, cannot read property style of null.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.210
From what you know about the DOM and how to manipulate

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:29.459
things in the loading of JavaScript,

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:31.989
try and think about why this might be.

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:35.000
We'll look at how to fix this in the next section.
