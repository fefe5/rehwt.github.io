00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Here's the project that I've downloaded.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.125
I can just take this HTML file and drag and drop it onto the browser window back here.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:09.470
And this is the Udacity website.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.145
I can scroll all the way down here,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.974
and we can see all of this content,

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:19.054
and this is what the Udacity website looked like when I downloaded it.

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:20.429
Switching over to the code editor,

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.564
we can see that we have one HTML file and one JavaScript file.

00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:28.750
And then all of the site files are in this directory here.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.977
Remember that this is just the index file to the project.

00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:34.500
This isn't every single page on the Udacity website.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.060
It is just the home page.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
