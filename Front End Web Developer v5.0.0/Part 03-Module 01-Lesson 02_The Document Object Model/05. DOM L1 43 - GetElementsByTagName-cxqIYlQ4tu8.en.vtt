00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
I am on the Introduction to the DOM page.

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.070
And if I just scroll through this page,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.272
we'll see that there are several instances of code.

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:12.955
Here and here are some others.

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:14.980
Let us look at one of these.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.685
Right click and choose "inspect" element.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.629
We can see in the elements panel that they are using pre tags.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:23.605
So here is a pre tag and here is a pre tag.

00:00:23.605 --> 00:00:28.410
let's you use "getElementsByTagName" to search for all of these pre tags.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.870
I could open up the console with escape and

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.314
then type out "document.getElementsByTagName",

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:40.400
and I can search for the pre tags.

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:44.420
And we can see that this returns a list of six items.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.500
Now if we want to see where each one of these are in the DOM,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.549
I can actually right click on one of them and choose "Reveal in elements panel",

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.029
and that will jump to the correct location and the elements panel.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.645
And then from here, I can right click and choose "Scroll into view",

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:02.856
and that will scroll the page into view to show us that element.

00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:04.334
And there it is.

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:06.409
So we can see by highlighting here.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.399
And by masking it over here it highlights the same element.
