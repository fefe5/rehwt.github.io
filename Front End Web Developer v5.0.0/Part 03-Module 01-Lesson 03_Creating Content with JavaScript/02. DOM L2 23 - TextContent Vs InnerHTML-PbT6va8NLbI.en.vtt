00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.919
Let's scroll down here and update this headings text.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:06.753
Now, to make it a bit easier to read.

00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:10.599
I'm just going to bump up the font size a bit.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.382
Now that I've selected the element in the DOM,

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:26.500
let's use the "$0" trick to store this element in a variable.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.594
Now that I've stored this element in a variable,

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:29.849
which we can see here,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.810
let's update the text of this element.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.704
Using the "textContent" property and setting it to this string,

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:44.244
we can see that even though we're adding HTML right here.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:49.390
That HTML is still being displayed over here in the actual rendered page.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.804
Now, let's compare the "textContent" property

00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:56.604
with setting the same string with the "innerHTML" property.

00:00:56.604 --> 00:01:01.467
So, using the same string with the HTML characters,

00:01:01.468 --> 00:01:06.905
this now shows up as rendered HTML because we're using the "innerHTML" property.

00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:10.430
So "textContent" displays everything as text

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.000
while "innerHTML" will render any HTML in the string.
