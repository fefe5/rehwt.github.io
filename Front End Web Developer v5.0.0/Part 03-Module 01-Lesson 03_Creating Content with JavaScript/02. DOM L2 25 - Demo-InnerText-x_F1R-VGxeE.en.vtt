00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
I stored this page element inside of the "card" variable.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.000
Now let's compare the card's text content property with its innerText property.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.050
But before we do that,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.425
let's actually hide some of the text with CSS.

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:20.260
Here we can see the "New!",

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.800
the "Data Foundation's Nanodegree" and the "Enroll Now" text,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.839
but over here on the element itself we only see

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.059
"New" and then "Data Foundations Nanodegree".

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:31.209
We don't actually see the words "Enroll Now" which were down

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.750
here because I hid them with CSS, display none.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.045
So, let's check out the card's text content property.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:44.020
And this shows us all of the text of the element.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.200
Now let's compare that with innerText.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.040
We can see that the innerText property does not have the text "Enroll Now".

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.479
It's missing from down here,

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.560
but there's also new is all in caps up here,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.054
while new actually is only capital N as you can see up here.

00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:03.429
The text content property returns all of the text regardless if CSS.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.000
The innerText property returns the text as it would be seen visually.
