00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
We have the heading, Learn ARKit,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.344
but let us say we want to add some extra text to the end.

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:09.275
Let us create a Span tag to hold this extra text.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.884
So, we're creating a span element,

00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:17.285
and now let us store it in a variable.

00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:19.410
So we have created span,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.379
and we have logged it out, and we can see we actually have a span element.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:29.168
Now, let us add some text to the span.

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.734
So we have created the span element and added some text to it.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:37.390
But how do we actually add it to the page so it will show up right here?

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.000
That is what we are going to look at next.
