00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's elect this card by clearing the DOM and searching for

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.109
this first anchor element with a card class.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:14.911
Now let's check out its text content.

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:21.120
We can see that the text content property only displays the text of the element.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.467
Now, let's move this up a bit,

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:28.905
and then compare this to card's inner HTML property.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:33.689
You can see that the inner HTML property provides all of the HTML for

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:39.079
the inner element while text content only provides the text of the card element.
