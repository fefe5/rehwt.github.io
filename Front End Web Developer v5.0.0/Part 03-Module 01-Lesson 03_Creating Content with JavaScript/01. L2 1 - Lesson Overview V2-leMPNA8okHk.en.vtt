00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.875
You've made it. We're here.

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:04.900
This is the lesson where we start to actually

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.785
control the document object model with Javascript.

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:10.490
In the last lesson, we learned about the DOM,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.980
the Document Object Model,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.635
and in it we learned a few ways to select items in the DOM, ".getElementByID()",

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:21.730
".getElementsByClassName()", the ".querySelector()", and a few others.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.120
And we looked at the Node and Element interfaces and the list of

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.469
properties and methods that they pass on to their individual elements.

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:30.849
Now like I said at the beginning,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.840
this is the lesson we'll use Javascript and DOM methods to create,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.420
delete, and manipulate DOM elements.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.899
While working through this content,

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.480
you'll start to gain an understanding of

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.734
the real power of combining JavaScript and the DOM.

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:46.640
If you can't tell already, it's really exciting.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.145
Now before we dive right in though,

00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:52.000
we need to download the project that we use for the rest of the course.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.100
Okay, you ready? Good. Let's get started.
