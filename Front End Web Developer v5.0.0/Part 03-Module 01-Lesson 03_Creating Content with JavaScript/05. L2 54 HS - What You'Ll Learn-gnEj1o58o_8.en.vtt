00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.094
Have you ever filled out a form on the web? I'm sure you have.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:05.804
I do it dozens of times a day.

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:08.830
Now, have you ever paid attention to when you make a mistake?

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.265
An error message might pop up or one of the form fields might have a red border.

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:15.495
All of those are style changes.

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:21.149
In this lesson, we'll learn how to control page dialing with JavaScript and DOM methods.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.139
We'll look at the style property,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.949
the CSS text method and the classList property.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.419
Now unlike previous sections,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.620
we'll control a lot more visual changes to the page.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.000
So I hope you're ready and excited. Let's get started.
