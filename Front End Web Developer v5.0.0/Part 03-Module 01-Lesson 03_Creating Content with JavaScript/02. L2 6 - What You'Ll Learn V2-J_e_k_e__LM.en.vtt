In this section, we'll look at "innerHTML" to get

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.620
the HTML content and set the HTML content of an element.

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:13.439
We'll also look at "textContent" to get and set the text content of an element.

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:18.410
And we'll look at "innerText" which also will get and set the text content of an element.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.734
Yes, both "textContent" and

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.015
"innerText" will let you control the text content of an element.

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:27.484
But there are some considerable differences between the two methods.

00:00:27.484 --> 00:00:28.894
By the end of this section,

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:35.204
you'll know how to alter both HTML and text content of any element on any website.

00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:38.000
I think that's pretty cool. So let's get going.
