00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
There's a lot of stuff going on right here,

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:04.214
but we can see that this anchor element,

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:06.214
is this card right here.

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:08.535
And it has a class of card.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:12.220
Let's switch to the console and search for this card element.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.390
I'm querying the DOM for the first element with a class

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.600
of card and I'm saving it to the card variable.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.405
Now let's call "innerHTML" on this.

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:28.700
And we can see that we have all of the HTML here that we do up here.
