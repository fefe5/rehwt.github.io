00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.875
You just learned about modifying existing content.

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:07.234
In this section, we'll build on top of this knowledge by creating

00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:11.768
new content and adding it to the page with the "createElement" method,

00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:15.410
the "creatextNode" method, the "appendChild" method,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.664
and the insertAdjacentHTML method.

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:22.625
You should be able to tell what these first three methods do just by their names,

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:25.210
but we'll dig into them all in detail.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.530
We'll look at the "createElement" method first,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.010
but I want you to do some of your own research on this one.
