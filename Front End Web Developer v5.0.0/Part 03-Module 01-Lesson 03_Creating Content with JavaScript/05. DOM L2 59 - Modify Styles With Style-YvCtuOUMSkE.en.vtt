00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.293
Let's select this heading right here out of the DOM.

00:00:07.293 --> 00:00:12.350
Now this gray color is pretty on brand,

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:20.399
but let's make it something exciting like orange.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.824
We can see that running this command has changed our text to Orange,

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:26.689
and now it has a style property right here.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.415
And if we open up this,

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:31.359
we can see that it has a style right here.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.640
Now let's give ourselves a bit more room here.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.548
Our heading looks pretty good right now but it is quite tiny.

00:00:38.548 --> 00:00:42.130
So let's bump up the font size,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.829
much better and we can see the font size right here and right here.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.652
Let's check out heading dot style to see what it shows us.

00:00:59.652 --> 00:01:05.215
We can see that this property returns a CSS style declaration.

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.515
And let's open that up,

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:12.444
scrolling through this we see that most of these things are empty.

00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:14.639
There's our color that we added.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.989
And somewhere down here is going to be the font size there it is.

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:22.464
If we scroll back up a bit there should be a section.

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:27.280
This CSS text will actually look at that in just a few minutes.
