00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
Welcome everyone to web API's and asynchronous applications.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.990
It's what we're all here for.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.060
My name is Daniel, and I'm going to lead you

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.919
through the process of learning how to develop

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.650
an asynchronous JavaScript web app that uses

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.510
an external web API and dynamically updates the U-I of your web app.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.350
Now, before we dive into the exciting details,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.910
let me introduce myself a bit.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.140
So you have some idea of who it is that's trying to teach you all this JavaScript.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.960
My name is Daniel.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.190
For the first half of my professional life,

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.710
I directed an arts-based Public Health Program for young people in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.740
I was also a storyteller and a performance poet,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.780
including being a national poetry slam champion and an artist and residence at UC,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.344
Santa Barbara, where I taught a class titled,

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:50.214
The Poetics of Struggle in the English Department.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:53.240
Now, stemming from my work with youth and my poetry,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.210
I became fascinated with the ability that technology

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.670
presented to communicate big ideas and be harnessed for social good.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.460
I received my Master's degree in Interactive Telecommunications at

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:10.254
NYU and began synthesizing my creative background with the technical skills of coding.

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:12.429
Since earning my Master's degree,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.600
I've done Digital Design and Development as

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:17.905
an employee at vid code and code Academy in New York.

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:20.269
Working on interactive curriculum topics

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:23.209
ranging from test-driven development with JavaScript,

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:25.654
to data visualizations with Python.

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:27.230
That brings us to here,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.850
the topic of Web API's and Asynchronous Applications.

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:35.359
Let's take a quick overview tour of the path will go through on this learning process.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.655
This course will begin by teaching you how to set up

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:40.055
a Node and Express development environment,

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.850
which is the essential combo for making many a web application.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:47.765
Understanding how to use even the basic functions of Node and Express,

00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:51.155
will unlock a whole world of development possibilities.

00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:53.855
Maybe you have already heard of Node or Express.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:56.840
Maybe you've tried it on your own already and feel confused or

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.210
frustrated or maybe you've had some development success with Node and Express.

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:02.919
No matter where you're coming from,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.920
I promise you will learn some fundamental knowledge about how web development works,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.319
starting from the Node and Express lessons.
