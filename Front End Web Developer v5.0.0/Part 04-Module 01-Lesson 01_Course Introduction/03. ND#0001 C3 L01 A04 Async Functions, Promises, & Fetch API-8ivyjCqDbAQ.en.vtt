00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
Then we'll bring it all together with asynchronous JavaScript.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.620
I heard a very thoughtful person once say that as humans,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.490
it's hard for our minds to wrap around the idea of asynchronicity.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.949
Well we'll take on that challenge and unlock

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.144
the hidden potential of asynchronous JavaScript.

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:20.384
We'll cover how to set up and dynamically access

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:26.250
Web API data and how to use the Fetch API to easily and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.910
elegantly make HTTP GET and POST requests from

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.594
the client side code and seamlessly process that data from the server side code.

00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:39.299
Now a great deal of what we'll cover in this course,

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:42.178
is made possible by the relatively new feature,

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.605
a promises made native in JavaScript.

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:49.939
We will rely heavily on promises through the Fetch API and you'll be able to

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:54.559
use the new elegant syntax to create seamless async web apps,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.385
and if any or all of that sounds like nonsense to you now,

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:02.210
make sure you come back and watch this video after completing the course,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.489
to see how wise and talented you've become.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
