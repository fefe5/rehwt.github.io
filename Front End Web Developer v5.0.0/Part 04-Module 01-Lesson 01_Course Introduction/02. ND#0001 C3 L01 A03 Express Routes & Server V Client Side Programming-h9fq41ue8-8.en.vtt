00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
After setting up our development environment and

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.759
installing all the necessary project dependencies,

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.500
we will cover how to set up routes,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.044
they handle passing data through your app with HTTP post requests.

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:15.759
The two requests that will cover most are GET and POST,

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.170
which are two of the most popular HTTP post requests,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.900
and will go well with our async application.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.309
We will also use this opportunity to shed light on what

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:28.654
is often one of the more confusing development topics.

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:33.935
The difference in relationship between client-side code and server-side code.

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:36.560
We'll go through what each of these means and how to write

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.810
them in harmony with one another to create

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.539
a complete app that passes data back and forth

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.839
between a server endpoint and the UI of your application.
