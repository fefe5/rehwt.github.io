00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
Express is a simple web framework for

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:06.810
Node.js that offers powerful tools for web applications.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.699
Express has a great deal of love in

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.364
the development community and we'll cover some of the most popular uses for Express.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.750
Express gives easy access to

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.714
common web application settings like the port to use for connecting a Local Server.

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:26.713
Express also allows you to use HTTP routes and requests with easy handlers,

00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:30.329
which makes the life of a developer so much easier.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.049
Middleware. Middleware is one of

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:36.859
the hardest part of bringing really any big web project together,

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.655
Middleware is the glue that holds the different parts together.

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:42.439
So an example for us is,

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:44.269
we're going to need a data parser,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.840
something that takes in the data from the web and parses it

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.740
back and forth between the server in case they're speaking slightly different languages,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.690
like String vs JSON.

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:59.134
One of the most simple but powerful applications of Express is the.Use method.

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:01.879
This allows us to instruct our application to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.700
use the necessary Middleware such as body-parser.
