00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.745
One of the reasons that server and client-side coding can be so confusing,

00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:06.515
is that it has a different setup,

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:09.684
a different folder structure than you might be used to.

00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:11.640
When I say a folder structure,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.550
what I mean is how the files are organized,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.695
that eventually make up our web app.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:19.560
So web projects that don't include a server,

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.979
they generally have all their files included in the same folder,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.339
one folder, that the web knows to just look at a file

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.045
called index.html to get all its directions from.

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:34.079
You would also have any CSS or JavaScript files in that same folder,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.945
which is being read directly by the browser.

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:42.049
However, when developing web projects that include an Express Server,

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:45.409
there needs to be an additional file created that is outside

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.549
and the same level as the folder that includes the index HTML,

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.544
and all the other browser folders.

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:53.685
So one file, the server file,

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:57.770
is for node, and the other folder has all the files for the browser.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.395
Let's look at an example of what that might look like.

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:02.160
So in this example,

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.664
because the name of our folder containing all the browser files is website,

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:09.185
in our server.js file,

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:13.939
we would put the code app.use(express.static('website'));

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.280
which is just a string representing

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.295
the name of the folder we want to point the server to.

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:23.740
If we go back to the example we were looking at with the full code,

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:26.104
we see a very similar line.

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:31.820
The only difference here is that we passed in the string demo instead of website,

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.449
because the folder we want to go into is called demo.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.620
If we wanted our server to point to website we would just put website.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.155
The structure may take a bit to get used to,

00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:44.435
but once you start writing code differently,

00:01:44.435 --> 00:01:48.090
your mind will start to understand the logic of this setup.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
