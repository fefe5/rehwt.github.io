00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.214
Let's take a look at what using Node looks like in practice.

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:10.004
The first thing I want to do is check what Node version I have.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:14.820
I see that I have node and I'm running version 10.15.3,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.730
which sounds amazing to me.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.515
The next thing that we want to do is to install some dependencies.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:26.490
So for example, we know we'll want Express.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:36.429
So I'll type the command npm install express, and we watch it go.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:42.079
Now, let's try installing some middleware.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.250
We'll do npm install body-parser.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.964
Okay. Back out to the big picture.

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:55.880
So far, we've learned that Node.js is used to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.580
run server-side code and that we can install and

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.920
include different packages and our Node projects from

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.549
the command line using our package manager npm.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.549
Next, we will learn about Express,

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.849
which is one of the most popular and powerful Node packages
