00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
Let's talk about Node.js.

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:05.865
Node is an open-source, cross-platform,

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:09.150
JavaScript server environment that allows you to

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.905
execute code outside of a browser in addition to within the browser.

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:16.050
Node allows you to easily create

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.054
real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:22.920
This makes it perfect for developing web applications,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.635
which can be used on any number of screens.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.290
One of the most powerful things Node allows is for

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.184
developers to write server side scripts.

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:34.829
Server-side code produces dynamic webpage content.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.254
One example of dynamic web page content is Persistence.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:42.560
Persistence describes a web app being able to maintain

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.145
created data across visits from the webpage.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:49.445
So for example, when you post a Facebook message,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:53.450
persistence allows for that Facebook message

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.375
to be shown every time that you or someone else come back to that page.

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:04.219
Node essentially allows you to write code that can be executed outside the browser,

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:10.194
which is otherwise very difficult to nearly impossible to do with JavaScript.

00:01:10.194 --> 00:01:14.449
If that's not enough, here are some reasons why I love Node.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.939
It allows me to easily create a server for

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.420
local web development without needing an FTP server or

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.240
my own domain and it lets me install packages that are dependencies for my project,

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:28.384
very easily and from the command line.

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:32.120
It also allows all the moving parts to come together to work in

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.810
a perfect precision to make Async web apps possible.
