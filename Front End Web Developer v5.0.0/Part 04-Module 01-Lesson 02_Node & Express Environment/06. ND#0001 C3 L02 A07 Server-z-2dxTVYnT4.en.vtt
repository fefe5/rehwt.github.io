00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.505
Often the first thing done in a Node and Express environment is to create

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:10.859
a simple local server that will allow an app to run locally in a browser.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.535
A server receives requests,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:19.250
processes those requests and then returns a response.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.160
For our purposes, we'll be using a server to run

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.980
our website locally without any FTP servers or

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.679
other hosting solutions and to create routes to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.269
dynamically pass data between different parts of our apps.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.170
Now, let's take a look at the code we would use to actually write this server.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.515
So the first thing we want to do is to set our variables.

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:42.695
So here we set our variable to port 8000.

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:44.179
You can look more into ports,

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.979
but 8000 is popular, 3000, 3030, 8080.

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.379
You could be creative with your naming.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.410
The next thing we do is we set

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:02.254
a variable named server and then we pass the listen method, two arguments.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:05.015
The first argument is the port which we set up here.

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:07.489
This will tell us our server which port to run

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:11.314
on and you'll actually go to that address in the web browser.

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:16.129
The second argument is a callback functioning which we have named listening.

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:18.274
So when our code runs,

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:21.870
server will start listening at port 8000,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.140
and then we'll run the function listening.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.370
Here, we see that function listening will log out,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.109
the server is running and it will tell us where it's running on which port.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.250
Let's take a look at that.
