00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
My name is Daniel Hershel Silber-Baker,

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:06.629
and I am from Oakland California.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.914
I grew up in Berkeley California and I currently live in Los Angeles California,

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:18.239
and this my friends is coming to you live from Mountain View studios Udacity.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.229
Really many to most of the skills that are taught in

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.370
the course are things that I would use every day doing web development.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.710
I mean, I think we're at a point now where web development

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.920
really demands a synchronicity as an option and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.750
so the Fetch and promises this is really the meat of the new JavaScript world I think.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.789
So I think there isn't really,

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.685
it's hard for me to imagine a topic that's more relevant.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:47.990
Anytime you want to work with any web API or anything that demands a synchronicity,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.344
I think Fetch and chain promises really are the solution there.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.009
After completing the course,

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:55.729
students should be able to build

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.250
their own asynchronous applications that use an external web API,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.200
and really I think that's one of the fundamental skills that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.049
employers are looking for now is your ability to put up

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.545
quickly an async web app that is dynamic and can

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:13.370
interact with different spaces and bring together a unique experience.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.930
So for me, the idea is to give you the underlying skills that would allow

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.850
you to use asynchronous applications to build up whatever kind of app you're looking for.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.699
Any app is going to need data coming in and out of it,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.600
and I think what we've really solidified here is that there's an elegant syntax

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:33.739
to the Fetch API and that promises are the best solution in this space.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:35.449
So putting together this course,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.700
my hope is that by the end of it,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.609
you'll have at least one portfolio project,

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.219
an app that you'll be able to put into your portfolio,

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.409
and I think another important thing is to match

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.709
your code with any app that you put up in a portfolio.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.009
So this would be a good chance if you haven't already to start a GitHub.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.590
One thing I've found is that GitHub repos are

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.775
commonly asked for in job applications situations.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:00.620
So this would give you an instance where you have a project you can put

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.350
up on your portfolio and a code repo that you can

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.289
create in GitHub so that people can see you know how to work

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.469
back and forth from different branches and make things happen.

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.199
So this nano degree program should really put you

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.169
on the course to be able to apply it to some real-world jobs.

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:19.729
I think some ones you might be well-suited to look into really anything on the front end,

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:25.399
front end engineer, something having to do with UX or UI or a common web developer.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.780
Once you have these skills to make asynchronous applications that include data,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.009
you're really well equipped to do

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.429
web development and eventually to do front end and engineering.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.640
In my experience, hiring managers are really

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.149
looking for people who understand the logic of what they're doing.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.340
It's one of the reasons that throughout the course,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.060
we really try to make sure you understand each step and why you're doing it.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.504
I think usually people want someone who can come up with creative solutions,

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.003
and to do creative solutions,

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:58.189
you really need to have a repertoire of what the tools are at your disposal.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.349
My hope is that through this process,

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.959
you'll build your tool sets so that in any situation,

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.180
you could show your different skills as you

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.930
navigate the particulars of any issue that you're facing,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.555
the process of making this course.

00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:14.540
I really feel like I've got to watch it come alive.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.989
At the beginning, I'm just typing on a computer or trying to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.530
figure out a different arrangement for Google Docs and Google sheets

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.875
and then really when it comes alive is when I get to

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:28.879
give it to the world when I present the possibility to other people.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.810
So our first step has been done here this week as we all get together as a team and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.099
make sure that we have everything set to offer you the best programming that we can.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.280
But the real excitement comes now that it's to you,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.289
we want to see what you'll do with this.
