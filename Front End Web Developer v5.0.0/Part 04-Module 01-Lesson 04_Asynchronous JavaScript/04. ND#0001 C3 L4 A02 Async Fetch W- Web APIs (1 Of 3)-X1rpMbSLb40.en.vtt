00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
The Fetch API is built on top of native JavaScript promises,

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.939
which make it ideal for working with Web APIs.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:12.179
A web API is an application programming interface

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.910
for either a web server or a Web Browser.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.195
Some of the most popular web APIs are

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:23.310
weather data and financial data that can come from places like Yahoo stops.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.359
But really, web API can be anywhere that someone has organized

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.210
information and made that data available to query through an API.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.125
For the sake of this lesson,

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.549
we're going to construct a dummy Web API

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:40.265
that we invent for the purposes of demonstration.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:44.344
So close your eyes or open your ears,

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.509
and imagine there's a web API that provides lots of

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:50.869
information about all the animals known to exist.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:54.709
Now suppose you wanted to create a web app that let people enter the name of

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.960
their favorite animal and then get to see

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.009
fun facts about that animal appear on their Browser.

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.159
Let's learn some more about the Fetch API,

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.009
so we can turn this dream into a reality.
