When working with a Web API,

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:06.255
there's a little bit of setup you have to do even before you start coding.

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:09.120
The first step is that for most Web APIs,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.864
you'll have to sign up for developer credentials.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:15.050
This is actually very easy to do if you go to any website.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.185
They usually have a Developer tab or something you can click on and it's free.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:21.239
You put your email address and you'll get

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.179
a key which is a code as a string of characters,

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.214
and that is what you'll use to access the Web API.

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:31.815
The second part is that you're actually going to build

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:36.929
a query by making a URL that includes the key that you got.

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:42.729
Let's focus in a little bit and think about what it means to build this API.
