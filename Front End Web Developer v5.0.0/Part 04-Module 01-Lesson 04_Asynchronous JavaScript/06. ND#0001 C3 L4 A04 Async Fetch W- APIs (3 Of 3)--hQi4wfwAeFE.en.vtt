00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
Using the base URL that's provided to you by the Web API documentation.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.490
You'll start with something like this,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:19.695
http:// api.animalinfo.org/data?animal=.

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:26.490
So if you look at this, this is the setup for our made-up imagined into reality API.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:32.549
So what this means is when people go in their web browser,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.859
to this URL, if they completed it by adding an animal here,

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.244
like tiger, then that would query the tiger part of the Web API.

00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:45.244
If we come over and look at this in code,

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:50.089
we can see here we make the elements that will eventually

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.680
come together to make our dynamic URL query.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.969
So we have our base URL.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.460
This should look familiar, we just saw it on the slide.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.174
Then this is an example of the key you might get when you register for your credentials.

00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:11.719
So the first step in making a web app API is actually to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:17.224
set variables to hold the base URL and your API key.

00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:21.589
Then of course we need to know what animal to add.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.350
For that, we're going to use

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:31.789
the DOM selector so that we can take in the dynamic value that a user enters.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.330
So here we see the three parts of our URL.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:45.539
We'll learn next how to put those together and make a GET request from a web API.
