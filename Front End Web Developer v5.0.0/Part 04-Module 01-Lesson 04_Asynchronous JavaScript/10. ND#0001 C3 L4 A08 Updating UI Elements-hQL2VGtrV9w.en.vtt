00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
One of the most useful applications of chain promises is to use

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.449
Web API data to dynamically update the UI of an app.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:14.160
Dynamically updating the UI of an app means creating or changing

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.175
DOM elements based on data received in real time from the app or from an API.

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:23.295
In the case of our Animal Web API example,

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:24.645
this feature could be that,

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:26.745
when the user submits their information,

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:29.760
instead of just seeing the data in the console,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.914
we could actually display that data on the web page itself.

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:39.060
So the three steps to dynamically updating a UI are to first,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.255
create a selector for the element you want to update.

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:46.173
This would be an HTML element using an ID or class,

00:00:46.173 --> 00:00:51.519
and then the second is to identify the data that you want to update that element with.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.040
Then of course third is just to appropriately set that data to that element.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.030
Let's see what this would look like in a real coding situation.
