00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.009
Let's take a second to review

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.115
what a genius you'd become since first starting this course.

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:08.894
You've now learned how to set up a Node and Express environments,

00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:11.804
how to make routes through your server,

00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:14.775
and requests through your client side code.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:19.199
Then you've learned how to chain promises together to be able to work with data

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.149
dynamically that depends on outside sources and interactions.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.820
Finally, you've learned how to take all that together and in real time update the UI

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.409
of your app so that people can see the dynamic data interacting for themselves.

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.739
My hope is that really this is just whet your appetite

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.090
because all we've done is go over the surface of what's possible with all of this.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.170
What's really exciting to me is to think about all the amazing things that you

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.340
can do with asynchronous applications and web APIs.
