00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.304
Now let's take a look at a basic POST route.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:08.189
In this example, we're using our app instance again,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.675
and then we call the post method which also takes two arguments.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.540
The first argument here again is home,

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.403
so we'd be posting to the route of our project,

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:22.344
and then again we have a call back function, req and res,

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:26.445
and this time, we're going to have res send the feedback that says,

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.605
"The post has been received. "

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:32.325
In this example, we simply return a string,

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:36.570
but soon we'll learn how to store received data somewhere useful,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.200
where you'll be able to retrieve it with a get request when you need it for your app.
