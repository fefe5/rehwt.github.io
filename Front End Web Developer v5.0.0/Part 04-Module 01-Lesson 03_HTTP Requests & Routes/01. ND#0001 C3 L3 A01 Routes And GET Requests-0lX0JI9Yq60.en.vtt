00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
Now let's talk about routes and requests.

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:07.484
As a reminder, a server receives requests,

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:10.710
processes them, and then returns a response.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.695
Routes are used to handle these requests.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:17.879
The two most common forms of requests are at GET request,

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:22.859
which gets data and a POST request which sends data securely.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.939
Express provides methods that define routing,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.345
and these methods correspond directly to HTTP methods.

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:32.174
To understand this better,

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:36.604
let's take a look at an example using a basic Express get route.

00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:43.579
In this example, app.get is an express method to handle the HTTP GET request.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.945
So here we can see we're requiring express,

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:50.140
a package that we've included on the terminal.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.310
Then we set up an instance of our app using const app equal to express.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.920
Then here, we use the getMethod on our app instance.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.234
The getMethod takes two arguments.

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:07.939
The first argument is a string that represents the URL path.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.079
Here, we've just added dash which sets it to root or home.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.379
The second argument it takes is a function.

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:20.284
In this instance, the function we're naming the argument req and res.

00:01:20.284 --> 00:01:24.890
Req stands for request and res stands for response.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.780
So inside our function,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.620
we've added the line res.send that's our response.send hello world.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.755
Following this example, if we went to our browser and went to the home URL,

00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:42.129
we would see hello world presented to us.
