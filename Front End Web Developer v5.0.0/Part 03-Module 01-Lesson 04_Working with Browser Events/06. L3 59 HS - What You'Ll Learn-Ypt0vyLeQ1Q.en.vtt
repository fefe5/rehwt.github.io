00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
Remember back to when we were styling the page with JavaScript?

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:07.245
We briefly looked at the placement of the script tag.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:08.932
When it was at the bottom of the page,

00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:10.705
everything worked totally fine.

00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:15.094
But when we moved the script tag to the head, then everything broke.

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:17.699
This happened because the DOM wasn't ready to be

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.210
manipulated when the JavaScript code started running.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.240
In this section, we'll look at why this happens and how to

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.000
counteract this potentially problematic situation.
