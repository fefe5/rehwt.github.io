00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
This code will set an event listener on the document for a click.

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:06.629
And now, we're actually listening for an event object,

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.539
and we are going to log out that event object.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.099
Let's switch to the browser and see this in action.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.369
All right, let's click on the page and see what happens.

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.814
One, two, three, click.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:19.080
And we can see we have an event over here.

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.554
And specifically, it's a mouse event.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:25.079
Let's open it up and see what it contains.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.554
This has got a lot of information in here.

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:29.239
Let's look at some of them.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.129
For example, down here is Page X and here's Page Y.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.260
And these two values tell us the X and Y coordinate of the click event itself.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:40.243
Where was the mouse when I clicked on the page?

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:42.865
And we can see down here what type of mouse event was it.

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:44.850
It was a click event.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.440
Now how do we know what all of these properties

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:48.253
are and how do we find out more information?

00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:49.710
Because this is a mouse event,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.420
we can look at the mouse event interface.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.359
So this is the mouse event interface page,

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.859
and this will show us all of the information about a mouse event object.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.490
So all of the information provided by

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.000
a mouse event object is detailed here in this mouse event interface page.
