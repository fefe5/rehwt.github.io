00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
You learned a ton of stuff in this lesson.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.964
You learned about the secret world of events that are flying

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:09.099
all around your web page as you interact with it.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.125
You learned how to interact with these events,

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:13.150
all about the event lifecycle.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.440
And then we briefly looked at

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.219
why javascript code that modifies the DOM should be written at

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:20.559
the bottom of the HTML and how we can

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:24.250
circumvent this problem with the DOM content loaded event.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.368
So we're almost done,

00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:28.920
but there are a few performance related things that we need to talk about.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.000
We'll do that in the next lesson.
