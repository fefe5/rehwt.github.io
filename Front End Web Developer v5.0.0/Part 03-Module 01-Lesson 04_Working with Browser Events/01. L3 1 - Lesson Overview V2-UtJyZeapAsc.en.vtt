00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
In the previous lesson,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.459
you learned all about adding,

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.129
removing, and styling page content.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.449
But, did you notice that we did all of that work in the browser's DevTools?

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.509
That's great for testing, but it's not how it's really done.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.890
JavaScript code needs to be written in a JavaScript file.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.455
However, if we wrote everything in a JavaScript file,

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:23.679
all changes we make would instantly run when the page loads.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.629
For example, if you wrote some code to update

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:28.269
a heading to have a background color of sky blue,

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.079
that heading would have a sky blue background immediately.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.379
In this lesson, you'll learn how to run this DOM manipulating

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.990
JavaScript code in response to actions your users take.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.065
We'll look at what events are,

00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:43.039
how to respond to events,

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:44.829
what data is stored in an event,

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.530
how to stop an event, and more.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.484
I have to tell you that this is probably my favorite lesson.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.000
After completing this lesson,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.744
you'll be able to programmatically control the page.

00:00:54.744 --> 00:00:55.809
It's really exciting stuff,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.150
and it's fundamental to how all websites are made.
