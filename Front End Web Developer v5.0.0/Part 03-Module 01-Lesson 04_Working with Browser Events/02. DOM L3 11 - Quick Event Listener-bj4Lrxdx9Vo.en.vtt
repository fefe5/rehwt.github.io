00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.906
I'm here on the addEvent Listener documentation page

00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:06.019
and let's try out adding an event listener to this page.

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:11.394
We want our target to be the document.

00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:13.174
Now, what type of event do we want to listen for?

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:16.339
Let's listen for a click and now,

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:22.554
the listener function. Now, let's run it.

00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:26.594
Nothing's happened yet until we click on the page.

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:29.519
And let's click one more time.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.399
We can see that the number here is changing,

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.979
meaning this message is being called additional times.

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:37.599
So click, click, click, click, click.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.649
We can see all those clicks are getting counted and all the way up here to 22.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.759
So each time the document is clicked,

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:50.534
this function is run and since I clicked the page 22 times,

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:55.000
this message right here was logged to the console 22 times.
