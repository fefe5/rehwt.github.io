00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.484
Even though two objects look exactly the same,

00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:05.535
that doesn't mean they're identical.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:09.240
So the same information does not indicate equality.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.685
For example, look at my Udacity jacket.

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:14.839
It's dark, and it has the Udacity logo.

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.260
Now, look at this jacket.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.480
It's the same color and has the same logo.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.405
They look exactly the same, right?

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:24.260
But, now, ask yourself this,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.230
are they had the same jacket?

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.910
No. Of course, they aren't.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.789
This one's mine, and this one's Areetz'.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.674
Oh, there's my jacket.

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:36.299
Thank you.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:40.489
Now, if I call this jacket my jacket and someone else calls it Richard's jacket,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.395
they are two different names for the same object.

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:47.570
So, my jacket and Richard's jacket are referring to the same thing.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.515
When working with JavaScript objects and equality, you need to think about,

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.539
are they two separate objects,

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.000
or are they different names referring to the same object?
