00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
Let's take a look at event handlers setup for the different event phases.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.530
We'll use this same HTML as before,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.455
except this time we'll set a capture event listener to the paragraph,

00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:13.769
a bubble listener to the body,

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.169
and a bubble listener to the button.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.780
The important distinction is that the paragraph is set to

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.214
the capturing phase while the body and the button are,

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:25.097
by default, set to the bubbling phase.

00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:26.141
When the button is clicked,

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:29.870
it starts at the top again and works its way down.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.755
When it gets to the body element,

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:38.160
it doesn't run the function because we're still in the capturing phase.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.594
However, when it reaches the paragraph,

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:43.829
it will run the listener function.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.929
And it does this because this was set up to run in the capturing phase.

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.990
Then it moves to the button. It switches from capturing to @target to bubbling,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.420
then fires the listener.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.969
And again, it does this because this event uses

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.335
the default setting of running during the bubbling phase.

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:07.405
Then it works its way back up the HTML chain.

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:10.640
And when it reaches the body,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.765
it runs its listener function.

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:16.000
Then it moves to the HTML element and finishes.
