00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.634
I've got the project files open in my code editor.

00:00:02.634 --> 00:00:04.213
Now this is the JavaScript file,

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:06.120
and over here is the HTML file.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.400
Let's see where this file is loaded over here.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.755
This is right at the bottom,

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.790
two lines just before the end of the file.

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:21.519
So it's all the way at the end. So let's write an "Event Listener."

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.989
So we're listening to the document for a click and running this message right here.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.969
Let's check this out in the page.

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:30.864
Back in the browser, I've reloaded the page.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:34.074
And let's click somewhere, right here.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:36.135
And there's our message.

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:39.524
Now let's change up the "EventListener" a bit.

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:44.420
Let's say that I want to change the heading on the page,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.402
this heading to be exact.

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:49.219
Remember that, I can't use the "$0" trick here in the code editor.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.524
That only works in dev tools.

00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:53.269
So if we want to select a DOM element,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.770
we have to use the DOM selection methods like a "query selector" or "get element by ID."

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.960
To change the heading style,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.769
the first thing I need to do is select the element out of the DOM.

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:12.209
Now let's change its style.

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:15.297
This looks good to me. Let's switch back to the browser.

00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:20.820
Now clicking on this page should set the background color of this element to red.

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.694
One, two, three. I don't know about you,

00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:25.089
but I think this is really cool.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.079
Let's check this element in the DOM.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.519
We can see that this element has a background color of

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:34.295
red here and we can see that style applied here as well.

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:37.189
So this code work just as if we ran it in the console,

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.000
except now we're running it in our JavaScript file.
