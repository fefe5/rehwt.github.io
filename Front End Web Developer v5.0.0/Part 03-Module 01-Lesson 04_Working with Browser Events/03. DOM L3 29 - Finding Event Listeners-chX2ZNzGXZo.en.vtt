00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
In the project files, I've written this Event Listener.

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:06.165
So I'm listening on the body for a keypress.

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:09.539
Then I'm going to log the message removing first child.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:10.814
I'll look through the DOM,

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:13.094
for this element with this ID.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:15.929
I'll find its first child and I'll remove it.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.019
Let's switch over to the browser and see this in action.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.085
Here I am in the browser,

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:21.775
and let's find that element.

00:00:21.774 --> 00:00:23.579
It is contain-all.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.909
And it contains all of the visible content on the page.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.885
Now one thing I want to point out is that div tools

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:32.015
has an Event Listeners panel right here.

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:33.660
Now if I click on it, it will show us all of

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.704
the registered Event Listeners for the selected item.

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:42.070
As we can see, there are no Event Listeners for this div with contain-all ID.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.100
I can click the Ancestors check box,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.960
to see all of the ancestors to this element.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.560
And we can see that the body has a keypress listener.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.230
Hovering over this section here provides us a Remove button,

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.265
which will remove the Event Listener just for this time or session.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:59.338
Reloading the page will bring it back. Alright let's test this out.

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:03.954
So I'm going to click over here so that the page has focus and I'm going to press a key.

00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:06.355
And this element has updated.

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:09.640
Now watch this header. And I'm going to press another key,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.114
and I'm going to keep pressing keys.

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:13.584
And we can see that

00:01:13.584 --> 00:01:19.189
each first child element is getting deleted every single time I press a key.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:24.125
And last but not least.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:25.680
So, that's really cool.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.410
Another cool thing is that the Event Listeners panel will let us see

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.515
where the function was defined that actually runs.

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:35.909
So, if I choose this arrow right here and bring this down a bit.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.594
This handler here is the function that will run in response to the keypress.

00:01:40.594 --> 00:01:44.864
And I can right click this and choose show function definition.

00:01:44.864 --> 00:01:46.239
Doing that will bring us over to

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:49.905
the Sources panel and will show us where that function was defined.

00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:52.425
It was in app js and here is that function.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:56.799
We can see that the cursor is placed right at the beginning of the function.
