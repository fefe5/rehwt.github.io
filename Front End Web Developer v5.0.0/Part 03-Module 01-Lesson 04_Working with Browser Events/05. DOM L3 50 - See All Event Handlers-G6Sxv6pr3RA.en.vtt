00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.635
Here is the code you just saw.

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:06.434
It will create a div then they will create a paragraph at some text to that paragraph,

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:11.039
at an event listener to that paragraph and then add that paragraph to the div,

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.134
and it will do 200 paragraphs and add each of them to the div.

00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:16.454
As a child of the div,

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:19.354
then it will add that div to the body element.

00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:21.179
Let see this in the browser.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.335
Here we are instance the code used append child.

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:27.164
That means the div element is going to be at the bottom of the page.

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:30.619
So let us scroll down all way to the bottom there we are.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.675
Now let us right click on this first one and choose inspect.

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:35.890
So that is going to find that first paragraph element and

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.024
if I choose the event listeners pain,

00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:40.500
I can see that there is a click event listener for

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.859
this paragraph right here and I can click this paragraph,

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.484
and this paragraph and this one and we can see that

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:50.259
each of these paragraphs has the same click event listener.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:53.284
And actually every single one of these paragraphs,

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:56.000
has this same click event listener.
