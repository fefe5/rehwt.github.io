00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.028
To see the phases of an event,

00:00:02.028 --> 00:00:05.595
let's use this HTML code as an example.

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:09.330
We're leaving out some content but the important part is this button.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.810
Clicking on the event starts the whole process.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.250
We first start off in the capturing phase.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.925
It starts at the HTML element and works its way down.

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:25.710
Once it reaches the element that was clicked,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.160
it switches to the at target phase.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.200
Then, it switches to the bubbling phase and works its way all the way back up.
