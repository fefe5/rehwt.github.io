00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710
So, what is an event? Let me give you an example.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.650
Last year, my family had a family reunion with all of my aunts, uncles and cousins.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.929
Whenever it was time to eat,

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.349
we'd make an announcement and everyone would head to the dinner table.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.833
When we made an announcement that it was time for games,

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.714
everyone would go outside.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:19.486
Whenever we made an announcement,

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.949
people would respond and perform some action.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.644
They'd go to the table or they'd go outside.

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:27.434
An event is like one of these announcements.

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:29.129
When something happens in the browser,

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.064
the browser will make an announcement.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:34.500
And we can use Javascript to listen for the announcement and respond.
