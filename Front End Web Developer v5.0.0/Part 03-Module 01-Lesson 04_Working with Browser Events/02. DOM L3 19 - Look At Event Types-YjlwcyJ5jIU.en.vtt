00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
I'm on the event reference page,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.429
and this page lists out all of the different DOM events that can happen.

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:07.410
And what's really cool is that if we scroll down a little bit,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.266
we can see that they are grouped by common category.

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.464
What does that mean?

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:13.718
Let's scroll down a bit,

00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:19.320
and we can get to the mouse events.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.140
So these are all of the mouse events on page.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.823
And look, here is the click event that we keep seeing,

00:00:24.823 --> 00:00:26.690
and here's the double click.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.929
And if we use the mouse wheel,

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.649
there's the wheel event. Scroll up a bit.

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.475
We can see here are some keyboard events,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.645
pressing keys, letting keys up.

00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:36.054
And let's just keep looking here.

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:37.435
There are some other cool events.

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:39.630
Here's the scroll event.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.804
When you submit a form,

00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:42.409
there are the form events,

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.319
and here's the submit event when a form is submitted.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.174
It will fire the submit event that we can listen for and then respond to that.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.074
Then there are some other CSS events here,

00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:53.870
some for animation, some for transitions.

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.445
This page has a ton of information,

00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:58.000
and I definitely recommend you checking it out.
