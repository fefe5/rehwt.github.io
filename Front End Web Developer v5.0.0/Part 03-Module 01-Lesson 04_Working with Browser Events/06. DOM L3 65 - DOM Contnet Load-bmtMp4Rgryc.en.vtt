00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
Let's actually check out this DOMContentLoaded event.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:06.480
First, we need to switch to the "Network pain."

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.710
Let me bring this out just a bit.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.880
We can see it here. It's actually very hard to see and then it's right here.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.449
The easiest way to see it is down here at the bottom.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.570
We can see the event information right here in blue.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.135
DOMContentLoaded was at 245 milliseconds.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.560
Let me actually refresh the page and we can see it better.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.054
We can see right here, this blue little bar right there,

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:34.799
that's the DOMContentLoaded event and right here,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.219
it's kind of hard to see as well, but there's

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.710
a light blue line right here that's the DOMContentLoaded event.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.399
Again, we have the new information down here at the bottom of the page.
