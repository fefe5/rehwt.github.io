00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.775
Okay. Let's get into working with CSS grid itself.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:10.230
CSS grid is a two-dimensional design system for the web,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.365
which means you can organize content layout into rows and columns,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:19.934
which really means you can do almost anything.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:23.113
Rows and columns come together to make areas,

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:24.464
which can be named.

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:26.039
Oh my, CSS grid,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.960
there is so much fun to be had.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.984
But we need to start with the basics.

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:33.104
Everything starts with rows and columns.

00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:36.584
After setting the display property of your container grid,

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.070
your container div to grid,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.429
the next step is to set the rows and columns in your grid,

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.810
which can be done with the CSS properties, grid template columns,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.219
grid template rows, and if you see here,

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.114
grid gap defines the distance in between each row and column.

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:56.495
So in this example,

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:58.339
we would have two columns,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.484
two rows, and each of them would be separated by 15 pixels.

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:08.180
That's what we call the gutter between the rows and columns.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.190
Let's see an example of what rows and columns and CSS grid looked like in the real world.
