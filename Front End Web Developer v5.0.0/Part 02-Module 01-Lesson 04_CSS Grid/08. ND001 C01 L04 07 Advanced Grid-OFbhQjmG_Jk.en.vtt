CSS grid has so many advanced features.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:10.754
It really gives you control over every aspect of how content is laid out.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.410
In fact, there's so many things you can do.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.044
It can be a bit overwhelming.

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:19.370
So I wanted to try to take you through some of the new concepts and syntax

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.900
that CSS grid introduces that you might not otherwise be familiar with.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:29.959
These are algorithmic values and powerful tools for creating dynamic layouts on the web.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.840
These are things that include the FR unit,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.770
which is something that's going to allow us to take up the rest of the available space,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.260
track sizing using min-max,

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:45.259
which lets us set ranges for our rows and columns so that they don't have to be set.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:47.629
Let's take a look at these things in practice.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.960
These are the small things that really turn your work into something elegant.
