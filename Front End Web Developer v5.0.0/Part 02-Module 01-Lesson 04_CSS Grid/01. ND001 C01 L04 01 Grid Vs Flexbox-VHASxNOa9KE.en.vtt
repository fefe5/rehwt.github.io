00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.500
Welcome everyone to the showdown we've all been waiting for.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.535
In this corner is the new young upstart CSS grid.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:15.509
In this corner, it's the old favorite that originally changed the game;

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.204
flexbox.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:19.734
Okay, spoiler alert.

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:22.350
Despite much speculation and drama on the web,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.225
the truth is that CSS grid does not replace flexbox.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:32.510
That is, each can achieve things that the other is not capable of and in fact,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.989
a true master can use flexbox and CSS grid

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.520
together in harmony to create the ultimate web page layout.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.100
In this section, we'll quickly cover some of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.210
the differences between CSS grid and flexbox,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.195
highlight how they can work together,

00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:53.210
and then you'll take a deeper dive into the mechanics and syntax of CSS grid.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.039
At the highest level,

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.789
CSS grid excels at creating layouts for a web page.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.075
While flexbox is a master of content flow for

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:07.350
each element that makes up the page layout. Let's learn some more.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
