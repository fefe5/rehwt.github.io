00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.955
Okay. Rows and columns and CSS grid.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:08.985
The longest journey begins with the first step.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:14.295
So here we have set up a container element with display grid.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:20.670
Then in our HTML we have three divs with a class box inside of our container.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.160
You can see that CSS grid right out of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.655
the box comes with some distribution and alignment.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:28.860
We have box one, box two,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.595
box three here in one column along three rows.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:36.530
Before we do anything else let's look at the grid gap quickly.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.230
Again the grid gap is what allows you to put

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.410
more or less space between each element in a grid.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.880
So right now these elements have 50 px in between them each.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.305
But for example if we did a 150 pixels,

00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:53.010
you can see that they spread out much further.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.350
If we did 15 pixels,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.520
they become much closer together.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.910
These are called the gutters inside the tracks.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.325
Tracks are what setup rows and columns,

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.710
and gutters are the space in between.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.750
So what if instead of having one column with three rows,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.230
what if we actually wanted to have three columns.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.630
Inside of our container div,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.250
we could use the grid template columns property and then we could set three columns.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.510
The way that you do that is simply by entering three values.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.820
So 300 Px is the first column,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.325
300 Px is the second column and let's make the third column a little shorter,

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:41.215
we'll say 200 pixels.

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:45.005
So now we can see that we have three elements,

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:48.385
three columns and they are outside of our grid a little bit,

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:54.185
and that's because our width of our grid is less than the total of the columns.

00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:58.865
To fix that we can easily just increase the width of our grid.

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.930
For now I'll make it 100 percent.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.390
So now we can see our grid is plenty wide and we

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.539
have three elements each of them here in columns.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.595
Another thing we could do is change the grid template rows.

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:17.360
Here we can see we've set up three rows,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.240
so there's one column in the middle and each of

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.655
these boxes has taken on the height of the row we set.

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:30.600
So the first box is 300 pixels,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.710
the second box smaller is 250 pixels and the third box is large, 600 pixels.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.485
That is easy to change.

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:43.790
For instance if we wanted our first row to be much

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.605
bigger and our last row to be much smaller we could simply change the entries.

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:52.700
So now the first row is 600 pixels which means

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.275
that the first box in our first row will be 600 pixels.

00:02:57.275 --> 00:03:00.325
The second box is 250,

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:03.845
and then our third box is tiny, it's 60 pixels.

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:08.285
Now you might think why would a 60 pixel row be necessary?

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:10.580
But the truth is think about the web.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.625
Say footers for example.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:16.865
Every website has at least one bar on the bottom line that's really small,

00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:19.190
and this is a great way to set that up.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.040
By setting up our rows like this you can create

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.835
content tracks that makes sense for the type of content that you make.

00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:28.100
That's just a little bit what you can do with

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.875
grid template rows and grid template columns.

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:33.725
Coming up we're going to learn how to put them together

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:36.560
to create grid areas which allow you to setup

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.735
columns and rows to create

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:43.440
a whole system that you can then use to put your elements into.
