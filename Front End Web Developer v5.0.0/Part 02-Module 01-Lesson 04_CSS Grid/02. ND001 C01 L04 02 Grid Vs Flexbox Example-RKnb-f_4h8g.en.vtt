00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.104
So let's take a quick look at how grid and flexbox can work together.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.429
To start, I'm going to show you an example that I've

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.829
made and take you through it quickly,

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:12.780
but the truth is, you're going to learn how to build

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.195
this up step-by-step throughout the lesson.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:16.620
As you can see here,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.130
I've set up a grid using a container.

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:24.105
The first thing I've done is I've set the display to grid.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.990
We'll go through the columns and rows coming up.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.914
You can see I've set grid template areas,

00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:34.504
and here, each box uses the display flex.

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:39.630
Here's our HTML, three boxes, inside a container.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.050
The container has a display of grid and each box has a display of flex.

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.709
That's what's putting these words here in the middle.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.710
If you see, once we take flex away,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.174
all of our content is put back up into the top left-hand corner.

00:00:55.174 --> 00:01:00.489
However, with flex, we can center them easily.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.984
Now, there's just one more trick I want to show you,

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:06.469
and this one makes me really excited.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:08.929
So as you can see in our grid here,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.760
the distribution is a little funny.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.515
Everything is kind of leaning to the left, but grid,

00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:20.525
like flex, allows you to justify your content using justify content.

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:22.940
In this case, I want to see centered.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.109
So let's save that and then look at that.

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.515
Now we have a beautiful laid out grid,

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:33.590
two columns and two rows,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.094
all put beautifully in the middle.

00:01:36.094 --> 00:01:42.090
This is just one example of what you can do using CSS grid and flexbox together.
