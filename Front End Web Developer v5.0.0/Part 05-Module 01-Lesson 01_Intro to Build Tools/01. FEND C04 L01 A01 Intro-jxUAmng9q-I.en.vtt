00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.245
Hi and welcome to Course 4 of the front-end developers program.

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:06.720
In this course, we're going to be talking about

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.800
Webpack and I am your instructor Alyssa Hope.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.700
I've been a web developer for about five years now,

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.064
primarily doing front-end development and then sometimes full-stack development work.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:22.334
So I've spent a lot of time fiddling, fighting,

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:27.750
and building things with build tools and Webpack is one of the best ones.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.454
So I'm really excited to be giving this course and I hope that you enjoy it as well.

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:38.989
For me part of the reason that I was excited to be

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.859
doing this course is that when I learned build tools,

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.994
it was a huge step for me in my front-end career.

00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:50.089
I began to see websites not as

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.320
just some static files like just some CSS and some HTML that I would couple together,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.439
I really began to see my front-end as a living,

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.754
breathing program that I could interact with and I could

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:07.519
build rules and I had a whole lot more control over.

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:11.179
I think that learning build tools really

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.215
well helps you to see your front-end programs differently,

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:21.740
so that is my hope for you in this course and I'm really excited.

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:29.089
To get started, as an overview of this course it's constructed of four lessons.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.939
The first lesson will be on build tools generically,

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.965
why do developers use them?

00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:36.870
What problems do they solve?

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.165
Just kind of going over the main build tools that exist.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:43.245
Then in Lesson 2,

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:47.630
we'll have Webpack and talk about Webpack specifically,

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:51.964
we'll go into all the instructions of how to set it up and what makes it tick.

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:57.719
For Lesson 3, we'll talk about Sass and we'll talk about how Webpack works

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.230
with Sass as well as how web pack works with other professional web development tools,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.704
including production and development modes.

00:02:05.704 --> 00:02:09.229
That's one of the big things that you get with Webpack is being

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.869
able to create different modes for production and development,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.474
so we'll go into the specifics of that as well.

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:18.409
Then finally, we'll wrap it all up with Webpack and

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.974
service workers and talk about what service workers can do for your app.

00:02:23.974 --> 00:02:25.739
Through all of that,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.050
we'll have a good chance to let Webpack take us on

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.365
a tour through all of the most important professional front-end development tools.

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:38.689
A little bit about how I teach.

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:44.810
I was a lead instructor of a boot camp for a year and a half so I've seen a lot of

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.810
students learn code and go from

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.490
zero code to professional skills in a short amount of time.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.980
For me the biggest thing that I think you can do for yourself is to do it for yourself.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.289
For me, nothing beats having fingers on keyboards,

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:04.840
following instructions and seeing it happen,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.099
I really want you to get a firsthand experience with how

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.710
Webpack works and what it does and I think that will make

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.280
all of the concepts that we go over stick a lot better.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.465
Secondly, reading documentation is a coding superpower.

00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:24.740
It sounds a little silly but I promise it's true and it will help you go

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.090
really far in your career to just go back to the original source,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.965
like see what Webpack writes about Webpack and see how Sass talks about Sass.

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:37.430
It's a better way to learn those things,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.120
not all documentation is fantastic but a lot of it is.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.300
So we're going to go back and

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.189
talk and read the documentation for a lot of the technologies that we go

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.270
over in this course and I'm just going to keep sending you back to read it

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.350
and get used to that language and the way that documentation work,

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.264
so hopefully that will be a good experience as well.

00:04:00.264 --> 00:04:04.054
Finally, I've put in interview questions into this course

00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:09.140
so you get the chance to practice answering interview questions.

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.859
Either it will be me speaking the interview questions or sometimes I've

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.830
written them and it sounds silly but practice them,

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.969
practice them out loud,

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.125
practice recording yourself, practice writing down the answers.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:27.365
A lot of times, I've given instructions as the answer to the interview question,

00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:30.160
tips about what you should say,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.170
what opportunities you have in that interview question.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.550
Even if you're not thinking about interviewing anytime soon,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.670
it's still just a great skill to practice.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.465
So that's the book of the way that I teach.

00:04:45.464 --> 00:04:49.625
As one caveat or just one thing to be prepared for,

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:52.355
Webpack is a configuration tool.

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:53.995
It's not a simple tool,

00:04:53.995 --> 00:05:00.064
it's a complex tool for complex tasks and we're going to take it step-by-step,

00:05:00.064 --> 00:05:01.219
we're going go really slow,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.710
it's going to be really easy to follow along,

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:07.324
but we are going to spend a lot of time in the configurations.

00:05:07.324 --> 00:05:11.764
So even if it gets a little tedious, stick with me,

00:05:11.764 --> 00:05:14.824
I promise that the work will be worth the reward and

00:05:14.824 --> 00:05:18.870
we'll be able to make some really cool things by the end of the course.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.439
Just to give you a better picture of why you would want to take this course,

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:34.324
why web pack is important and what you're going to have at the end of this.

00:05:34.324 --> 00:05:36.649
When we finish this course,

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:40.310
the primary goal is that you would be really comfortable with

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.595
front-end build tools and we're going to do that by taking Webpack one step at a time.

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:50.405
My personal goal for you is that you

00:05:50.404 --> 00:05:56.000
would get a good picture of technologies that are used on professional teams.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.269
The reason I think this course is the most exciting course of

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:03.649
the whole program is that we're going to level up your front-end skills.

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:08.299
We're going to take you from building just HTML and CSS

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.564
and we're going to just bring that all the way to what you would actually do in a job.

00:06:13.564 --> 00:06:17.350
So I think that's awesome, I hope you do too.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.330
When you work with build tools you'll

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:23.044
get a whole new perspective on your front-end project

00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:28.460
and you'll begin to see the whole scope that's really possible.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:34.055
So hopefully, this will be a new page for you as you get

00:06:34.055 --> 00:06:41.519
to continue your front-end journey and I'm excited for the rest of the course.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
