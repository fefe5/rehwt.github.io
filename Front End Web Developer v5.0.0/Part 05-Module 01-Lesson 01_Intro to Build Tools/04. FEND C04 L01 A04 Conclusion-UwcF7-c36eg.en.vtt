00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
So we've come to the end of lesson 1.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.610
Hopefully, you've gotten a good picture of

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.730
just the world of build tools that's out there,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.130
and you feel comfortable answering the question

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.535
about why front end developers use build tools.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.160
Hopefully, you're feeling comfortable with some of

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.699
the things that we're using already like the network tab,

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.809
and getting used to thinking about the full scope of your front end project.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:26.354
In the next lesson,

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:29.910
we're really going to hit the nitty gritty of setting up web pack.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.320
So take a deep breath and we will get started.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
