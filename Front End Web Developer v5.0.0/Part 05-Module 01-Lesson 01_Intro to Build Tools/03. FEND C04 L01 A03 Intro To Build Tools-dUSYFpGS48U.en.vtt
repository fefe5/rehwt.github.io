00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
Okay. So hopefully you had the chance to try

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:10.169
out using the Network tab to inspect some of the other websites.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.199
You hopefully are getting a picture for

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.484
just how many assets are on all of these websites.

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:23.114
I would encourage you to just continue to use that Inspect tool.

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:27.689
A lot of times if I'm looking at a website and it looks really cool to me,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.900
I inspect element just to see what's there.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.189
I think you can learn a lot of front-end skills just doing that.

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.994
So continue that.

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:42.320
Now that you have a picture for what kinds of

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.685
things we're dealing with in a professional front-end application,

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:50.240
we're going to talk about what build tools are out there and what

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.065
they're actually doing to make that management easier.

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:58.369
So a good definition for build tools is that they allow

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.854
developers to automate their process for handling website assets,

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.075
saving them lots of time and headache.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:07.204
This is really true.

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:13.819
It's hopefully going to bring together our picture of what all of the build tools do.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:15.799
Not any one of them specifically,

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.009
but in general, build tools are management tools.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.425
They manage all of our assets.

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:24.569
We need them because without a management tool,

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.214
all of these assets is like herding cats.

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:30.890
You're going to run around trying to manage all

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.430
of your assets one-by-one and put them all into the head tag of your website,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.260
and it's just really going to get difficult as soon as you get more than a few.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.210
So in order to save ourselves that craziness,

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.729
we have a lot of these tools.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.615
Some of the common names that you'll hear in build tool land are Grunt and Gulp,

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:58.134
Brunch, Webpack, Bower, and some of these other ones.

00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:00.859
There are so many that I think sometimes that's

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.635
a barrier for junior developers to get into using build tools.

00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:09.349
It's kind of abstract what they do,

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.864
there's so many out there that it's hard to figure out where to start.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:17.469
Just to give you a bit of the lay of the land here,

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:23.444
NPM scripts are about as simple as you can go to manage website assets.

00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:28.219
Those are just normal NPM scripts that you would put in your package.json file,

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.680
and you can do quite a lot with those.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.659
On the other hand, you have Grunt and Gulp,

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.875
which are probably the most common names to hear after Webpack.

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:43.245
Grunt and Gulp allow you to write simple tools,

00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:49.580
simple rules that will allow you to manage all of your assets in a specific way,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.920
and they're pretty easy to set up.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.584
Webpack is probably the most common one right now.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:03:00.740
It really rose to fame alongside of React,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.165
and View, and some of those other JavaScript-based front-ends.

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:06.919
Webpack works really well.

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.750
It is JavaScript-based itself.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.180
So when you're working with JavaScript front-ends,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.075
you're very likely to see it.

00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:22.280
In fact, Webpack is used inside of the Create React app, React build tool.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.240
So you might have already used it without knowing.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.365
Here, why and how Webpack differs from other build tools.

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:34.250
Webpack is becoming the ubiquitous build tool.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.699
It's seen around all of these more modern frameworks,

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.125
and so you'll see it if you haven't already a lot.

00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:44.000
Grunt and Gulp are slightly simpler options.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.240
They'll allow you to build rules,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.689
but they don't have quite all of the functionality that Webpack has.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.859
If a project is simple enough,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.090
you might not need everything that Webpack does for you.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.979
So you can keep that in mind as well.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:03.534
Some of the reasons that we chose to do Webpack for this course though,

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:06.875
are that it is becoming so well-known in

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:12.004
front-end development that it's just a really good thing for you to know regardless.

00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:14.465
It's a little bit more complicated.

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:18.064
So if you learn Webpack from the start,

00:04:18.064 --> 00:04:19.920
if you need to go back to Grunt and Gulp,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.545
it really won't be an issue.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:26.085
Hopefully with those two things in mind,

00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:29.019
learning Webpack will be pretty easy.
