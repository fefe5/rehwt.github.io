00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.025
Let's dive a little deeper into this analogy of

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:08.820
HTML being the basic building block of the web.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.120
So I have two different metaphors here.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.519
The first one is a little squeamish for me,

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.990
but I've heard it works for a lot of people.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.434
So one way to think about these things is that

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:21.554
HTML is like the skeleton of your webpages.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.339
It's the bones. You might say,

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.570
I want a head here,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.920
and I want to shoulder here,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.330
and some legs down here,

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.399
that would be the skeleton you're building.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.979
Then the CSS could be like the skin or I might like clothes that go over it.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:37.199
It's how our head looks,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.265
and how our legs looks,

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:40.395
what color they are, what style.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:43.484
Then JavaScript can be thought of as the brain.

00:00:43.484 --> 00:00:47.075
It sends the functionality that should be done throughout these things.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:50.570
So I might have set up my head with HTML and then I might have put

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.755
my beautiful red hair on it with CSS and then my brain,

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.000
the JavaScript might say,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.359
shake your head back and forth like this.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.295
Now, you understand how webpages work.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:02.690
The other way to think about it,

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:05.375
it's a little more technical and I tend towards this,

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:10.340
which is to think about the HTML is really the foundation of your website.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.000
It's almost like if you were making a building,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.980
it's the bones of it.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.799
It's the pieces that are there.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.829
Then the style is what goes over

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.405
those things covered them to make them look like whatever we want.

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:27.004
Then the JavaScript handles the functionality and behavior.

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:30.064
So let me give you an example just with one element.

00:01:30.064 --> 00:01:31.655
Let's say, we have a P element.

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:35.689
That's the paragraph element which we know is HTML.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.114
Then I might want to say,

00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:40.699
the text for that I want it to be yellow.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.605
So that would be CSS.

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:46.075
So I've added CSS to the HTML.

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:48.375
Then the JavaScript part could say,

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.829
when someone hovers their mouse over this text,

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.944
I want it to turn blue.

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:57.804
So that we would use JavaScript to do because that the functionality.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:02.360
These things work together so well and there are endless possibilities.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.950
Let's keep exploring some more.
