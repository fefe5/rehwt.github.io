Welcome everyone to front-end web development.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.365
We're glad to have you here just as you are.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:11.234
We're going to start you right from the basics with HTML.

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:13.349
You'll learn how to make up the elements that are

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.574
the building blocks to everything you see on the web,

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:17.925
and then from there,

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:20.190
we'll go into cascading style sheets,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.525
so you can learn how to style everything you put up on the web.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.909
Have you ever looked at a website and thought,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.954
I can make something prettier than that.

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, now's your opportunity because we're going to take you through each step

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.005
that you need to know in order to make your own front-end web apps.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.135
You can impress your friends,

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:39.814
show off to your pets.

00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:42.469
You can become a creator of the new world that's

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.424
coming into play instead of just a consumer of it.

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:47.570
With front-end web design,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.929
you'll be ready to rock in the next phase of your life.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.804
I'm excited to have you here.

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:56.609
I hope you're excited to start. Now, let's go.
