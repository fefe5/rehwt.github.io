00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.209
Debugging HTML, debugging HTML

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:11.070
I think is just one of the best ways that you could possibly learn how to code.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.030
As a developer, you spent a great deal of time debugging your code,

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.750
trying to figure out where the errors are and how your code could be improved.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.359
Debugging can often feel like a nuisance,

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.309
but it's really one of the foundations of

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:26.399
programming and offers a great opportunity for learning.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:32.280
Debugging HTML is unique because there are no commands for feedback the way JavaScript,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.120
for example, has some built in error messaging and you

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:38.509
can console.log functions out to help debug.

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:42.469
Debugging HTML often means just reading through

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.089
your code line by line and looking for possible errors spots.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.950
So before I go too far in,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.280
let's make sure we understand what debugging is.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.620
Debugging is a term that implies that when programs aren't working the way we want,

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.934
it's because there's bugs or errors,

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.390
there's issues in them.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.000
So debugging is the process of looking through your code to try to find the places where

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.614
these bugs or errors are and then to resolve them in some way, and that's debugging.

00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:19.589
So what are some common HTML bugs?

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.100
Mismatch opening and closing tags are probably the ones I've seen most often.

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:27.515
Now these are particularly dangerous because

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:30.980
the browser will still render them without any issue.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.105
So you just won't see what you expect and you won't know what's going on.

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:38.240
So here, if you look closely,

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:44.219
you can see that I have an h1 opener tag but an h2 closing tag,

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.719
very easy mistake to make when I do all the time,

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:54.039
and very important to come through and closely look to make sure it's this an h1 or h2.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.505
I actually want it to be an h1.

00:01:56.504 --> 00:01:58.784
Now, this is an example,

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.944
a missing closing tag,

00:02:00.944 --> 00:02:06.529
which you see it's such a terrible error that if I uncomment it,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.360
it messes up the rest of my code because it's waiting here for that.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.060
But without a closing block,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.330
it's going to keep reading.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.400
So essentially it thinks I'm trying to say,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.219
my h2 is all of this,

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.384
and then all of this and all the way through.

00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:25.699
So looking for closing tags can be a very,

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.369
very, very important part of debugging.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.129
I would say the third most common thing I see is quotation errors,

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.689
because we use strings when we're writing.

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.680
Strings are texts that are wrapped in between quotation marks.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.990
So to not have a closing one means that your string is going to go on forever.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:55.430
There's what we want. Now we have the string here wrapped around in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.340
quotations and our string here wrapped around in quotations, and we're good to go.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.629
Now, the question, is do you think you're

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.174
going to be able to debug an HTML file on your own?

00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:12.990
I'm confidence you can.
