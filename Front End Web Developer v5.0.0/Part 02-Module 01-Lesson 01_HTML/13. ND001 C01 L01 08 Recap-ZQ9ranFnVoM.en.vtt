00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:07.839
You did it. You made it through the HTML lesson.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.609
Give yourself a round of applause.

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:12.855
Take a deep breath,

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:14.880
drink some water, get hydrated.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.160
You are doing an amazing job.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.344
Some of the HTML that we covered in this lesson is about

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:26.399
elements and how we make them and how we can add attributes to them.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.414
Then we also looked at debugging HTML,

00:00:30.414 --> 00:00:33.414
some of the biggest errors people see.

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:36.250
Then we got little hints of CSS,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.109
ways that we can style the elements on our page

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.030
using class or ID which are the attributes we've learned from.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.370
Coming up we'll learn how to separate out the concerns,

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:50.554
so that our CSS lives in a completely different file from our HTML,

00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:54.094
and those two things will come into perfect synchronicity

00:00:54.094 --> 00:00:58.739
to create the most elegant web page layout and design.
