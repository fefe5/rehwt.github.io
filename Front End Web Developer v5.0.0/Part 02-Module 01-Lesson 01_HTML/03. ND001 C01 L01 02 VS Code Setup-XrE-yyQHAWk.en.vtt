00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.790
Writing code can be monotamous, sometimes difficult task.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.070
So I'm really a believer in setting up an environment

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.810
that you want to spend a lot of time in

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.745
and that you're comfortable in when you're coding.

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:17.204
That's where text editors come in.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:22.004
Because remember, the amazing thing about code is that it's just plain text.

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:25.154
So it could be written in any text file you want it.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:27.770
But people have put together some of

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.344
the most comprehensive and customizable environments to be able to write code in.

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:35.149
So I quickly want to take you through my favorite and

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.214
an industry standard which is VS Code.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:44.210
Vs Code is an app that's going to allow us to do three things right now.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.750
First we're going to look at how you open an existing project,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.215
so you can have all your files right in the code editor.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:52.430
Then we're going to show you how to create

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.090
a new HTML file as something you'll need to do.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.660
Then I'll quickly show you through the plugin environment.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.839
We won't spend too much time there because,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.370
literally I've spent too much time there but you

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.325
can really customize your setup to be anything you want.

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:09.799
So the first thing I'm going to do,

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.039
is I'm going to open Visual Code Studio,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.570
new release notes which I'm sure are in enthralling but we'll skip for now.

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:21.469
So one of my favorite things about getting set up here is,

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.289
I can just drag the folder I'm interested in working on,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.930
which in this case is less than one HTML,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.745
which is where we are, and I can drop it right onto the Text Editor and it'll

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:34.280
open up for me on the side all of the files

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.370
that are there which makes it very easy to work with them.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.344
Now let's say from in here I want to create a new file.

00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:47.209
One of the ways I can do it is by using the Command N shortcut.

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:53.589
Another way is to go up here and to say 'New File'.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.630
A third way is, I can do it here on the sidebar.

00:01:56.629 --> 00:02:01.534
If I want to make a New File in my existing folder I can add a file right here.

00:02:01.534 --> 00:02:03.229
So let's add a new file.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.689
We want to learn how to make an HTML file.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.615
So let's call it 'learn' and then.html.

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:17.450
Just by adding the extension.html and saving that document it

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:22.639
knows that it is now an HTML document and can be read as such.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.679
So we've looked at opening a project,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.960
creating an HTML file.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.250
Now let's take a quick look at what some plugins do.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.224
These are the extensions that are available in VS Code

00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:39.409
there things from themes that make your syntax highlights look different,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.805
to Linters that will actually help you debug your code.

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:48.110
Let's look for anything that has to do with HTML.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.395
We can see there's an HTML snippets one.

00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:53.480
This would allow you to create auto tags.

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.099
This might be something worth coming back to.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.254
Let me tell you this,

00:02:56.254 --> 00:02:57.680
installing them is easy.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.314
You can just press 'Install',

00:02:59.314 --> 00:03:01.974
then I'll reset it to make sure it's activated.

00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:05.599
Now you'd be ready to start learning how to write your HTML code,

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.569
right here in this file. Let's get to it
