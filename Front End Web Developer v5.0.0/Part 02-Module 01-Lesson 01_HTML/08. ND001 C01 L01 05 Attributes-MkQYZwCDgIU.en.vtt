00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.269
So something I mentioned earlier is that all HTML elements can have attributes.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.049
Attributes provide additional information about an element and

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.830
are almost always specified in the start tag.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.794
So what are some examples of what attributes we might want to give elements?

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:24.420
Well, it varies on the type of element but for

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.000
almost every element an ID would make sense.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.120
An ID is an attribute that will allow us to programmatically

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.230
select and manipulate that element based on its ID.

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:37.454
Another example is source.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:42.030
Source comes into handy as an attribute for things like an image tag.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.820
An image tag will use IMG to say this is going to be an image,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.310
but to tell it where to pull the image from,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.350
we use the source attribute.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.100
Another very useful attribute is href.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.465
It could be argued that href is really the attributes that the web is built on.

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:05.855
Because href is what you use to a link to tell it where to go to next.

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:08.390
So if the web is a set of interconnected links that you

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.349
can follow by pressing on those links,

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:15.155
the href is what's sending you all around those places.

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:19.260
So let's take a look at this with some real code.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:25.310
So here we are with a file called attributes.html and we're going

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.290
to dive into some of the most useful attributes and see what they look like in practice.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.700
So the first thing I might do is just create a basic div and I'm going to give

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.859
it an ID, id equals love.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:48.769
We might as well have the text of this say, love will overcome.

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:51.420
Now, let's first check that it works,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.875
love will overcome, we see.

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:55.609
Now, this is jumping ahead a little bit to the CFS lesson,

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.034
but I'm realizing I would really like you to see why an ID might be useful.

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:03.530
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.485
quickly add some style tags which we'll go over much more in later lessons.

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:17.240
But now, because I have set the attribute here to the idea of love,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.180
I can access this div in my style.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.455
We prep end names with a hash sign or a pound mark for IDs.

00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:31.160
So #love is ID love.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:36.650
Then, I'm going to say color red.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.200
Now, we see that the text is red because I've used

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:48.364
the attribute an ID love and then I have used the style rule here to set it to be red.

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:52.325
That's one example of how setting an attribute can be useful.

00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:54.994
Let's take a look at an image.

00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:57.004
So to make an image,

00:02:57.004 --> 00:03:01.414
I need the image tag and then I need a source.

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:04.340
I think I have an image here.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.000
So I'm going to try just the name myImage.png.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.530
I feel like I'm missing something but the browser will tell us.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.330
Oh, and there it is.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.835
So another example of an attribute is actually I belief width.

00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:32.725
So let's try changing the width of that image to make it only 55 percent.

00:03:32.724 --> 00:03:36.310
Now, you can see we have a much smaller image.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.330
So here, it's an image element,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.295
we use an IMG tag.

00:03:41.294 --> 00:03:45.189
The attributes that we added were the source which is where the image is

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.389
coming from and the width which is the size that we want the image to be.

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.654
Another attribute I want to make sure to cover is the href attribute,

00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:56.455
as I've given it so much credit already.

00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:58.590
So if you don't remember that,

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.930
href attribute is something that goes to the links on the web.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.260
The way that we make links on the web is with an a tag.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.393
Because href is an attribute,

00:04:08.394 --> 00:04:10.145
we put it in the opening tag.

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:14.570
So a href equals and

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.134
then we want to pass the href the website that we would like it to point to.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:24.319
In this case, we'll go to udacity.com.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.584
We want to I like to say,

00:04:26.584 --> 00:04:33.049
follow this link to become a genius.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.920
Now, when we go back to our webpage,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.115
fingers crossed, we see our link come up.

00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:42.050
So follow this link to become a genius,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.855
we click on it and boom,

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:46.535
here we are at Udacity,

00:04:46.535 --> 00:04:50.410
ready to become brilliant.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.095
Those are just three of the attributes,

00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:56.960
but really each element can have any number of attributes and it can be

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:59.779
such a strong way to set up your code to be

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.144
customized and unique exactly the way you want it.

00:05:03.144 --> 00:05:04.959
As you go through this,

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.319
think about what other attributes you might like to see and we'll talk later about

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.764
how to do advance things using CSS classes and IDs.

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:20.060
Up next, we're going to talk about the DOM which is the space where

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.129
everything you do comes together in

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.939
a conceptual hierarchy that is laid out to the browser.

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:28.819
It will both blow your mind and make

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.639
you wish you didn't have to think about it, I promise.
