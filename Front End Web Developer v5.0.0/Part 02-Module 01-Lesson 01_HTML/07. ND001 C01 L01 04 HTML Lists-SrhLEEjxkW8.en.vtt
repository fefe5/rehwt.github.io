00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.774
Now the moment we've all been waiting for.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:09.570
It's time to talk about lists in HTML.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.800
Lists are amazing in real life and in web development.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.100
Let's say, one of the most useful structures that we have as humans.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.670
Think about how much of your life revolves around lists.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.310
Lists for groceries, and lists for to do's,

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:26.969
and lists for who to invite to your birthday party, top 10 songs.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:28.939
Lists are everywhere in our world,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.215
and it's important that we be able to harness and reproduce that usefulness in code.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:38.585
So HTML offers two types of built-in list structures.

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:43.535
The first is an ordered list and the second is an unordered list.

00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:46.834
It's a little self intuitive what these might mean.

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:50.899
But we're going to take a look at them in action so you can get a full understanding.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.170
Generally, an ordered list has a ranking to them.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.510
They're numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:01.759
whereas an unordered list is just a list of things without a necessary hierarchy.

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.189
This will make more sense in practice.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.799
So here we are back in VS Code,

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.795
and I now have a file called lists.html.

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:12.820
Here in the body again,

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:15.964
let's start with unordered lists.

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:20.734
Lists are interesting because they actually require a couple sets of tags.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:24.040
The first is ul,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.060
ul stands for unordered list.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.935
Then inside the ul,

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:37.159
for each element that you want to make an item in your list,

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.799
you use an li tag,

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.204
li like line item maybe.

00:01:43.204 --> 00:01:45.409
So here, I'll say,

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.909
Item 1, and then notice I'm still in between the opening and closing ul tags.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.299
I'm going to add a second item to my list.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.950
This one is going to be a Unicorn Horn Balm,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.390
in case our unicorn's,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.700
horn is hurting or whatever.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.104
Then let's add a third thing to our list.

00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:14.969
I'll make another li, Item 1 Unicorn Horn Balm,

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:20.819
and let's say garlic onion powder.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.685
It's going to be quite the party.

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:25.699
So now if I save this and come over to the browser,

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:29.460
voila, we see here a beautiful list.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.860
What I could do is I could combine what we've learned, say,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.165
and use an h1 tag to make a header on my list and I'll say,

00:02:38.164 --> 00:02:46.590
this is the grocery shopping list for Frank.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.060
Here, we have a title and our grocery shopping list.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.414
But what if we wanted these things to actually be ordered?

00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:57.134
It's a very, very similar process.

00:02:57.134 --> 00:03:00.264
Instead of ul, unordered list,

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:04.549
the tag for an ordered list is ol, ordered list.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.870
So just for fun,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.034
let's actually see what happens if I copy these from here and put them right here.

00:03:12.034 --> 00:03:17.090
So it's the same thing except I now have them in an ordered list,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.895
and here they are.

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:21.540
You can see now instead of bullet points,

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.069
they use the numbers 1, 2,

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.204
3, and that's all done automatically because they're inside the ol tags.

00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:32.965
So again, HTML has two ways for us to do lists built-in;

00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:35.930
ordered lists and unordered lists.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.775
Ordered lists use the tags ol and then li tag in between them,

00:03:42.775 --> 00:03:49.010
while unordered lists use the tag ul with the same li tags in between them.

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.965
This is just the beginning of what can be done with lists.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:54.409
But why don't you go ahead and give it a shot yourself?

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.639
Get your skills building for the next set of advanced lists we might make.
