00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.764
Let's take a look at how we might do a couple of these things in real practice.

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:09.719
Okay, let's get down to coding.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.480
So we have an HTML document here,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.355
and then I have that HTML document being red here in a Chrome browser.

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:21.435
Right now, there's nothing to see because we haven't written any code.

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:28.544
But, let's start by adding the h1 that we talked about earlier.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:37.590
You can see that there is a starting tag here and then a closing tag here,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.015
and anything we put in between those will be our header.

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:47.840
So here I might say HTML is awesome, and that's it.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.885
That's your first HTML element.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.644
Now let's make sure I'm telling the truth here,

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:55.250
and boom, there it is.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.810
HTML is awesome.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.650
So now let's see what would happen if we make

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.920
a paragraph which is the p tag and we say the same thing just to test it out.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.680
HTML is awesome, h1,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.935
HTML is awesome in a paragraph tag.

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:16.415
In our browser, you can see that the h1 tag

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:19.760
with the same tax that's produced this giant bold headline.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.314
The paragraph text is here looking more like it would be in a paragraph,

00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:25.539
which is pretty awesome.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.539
But as I mentioned,

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.140
sometimes we want to be even more creative and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.739
use text representation that isn't just built right in.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:37.459
So for that, we can use divs.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.269
A div can have a starting and a closing tag just like everything

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:45.459
else and this is where we start to assign attributes.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.479
Any HTML element can have attributes,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.135
and the attributes will almost always go inside the opening tag.

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:59.484
An example here is to say I have a div and I want to give it the attribute an ID,

00:01:59.484 --> 00:02:04.469
and I'll say that this ID is unicorn.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.125
So here we have a div with the id unicorn and what do we want it to say?

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:12.620
Probably something about unicorns,

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:18.289
it's hard to spell for something that's not real, unicorns.

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:27.564
All over the world sing songs of joy.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:30.629
So what do you think is going to happen when I refresh this?

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.764
There it is, it looks an awful lot like our P tags.

00:02:34.764 --> 00:02:40.254
Pretty soon, we're going to learn how to use CSS to identify the attribute,

00:02:40.254 --> 00:02:42.590
say the ID unicorn and then to set

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.700
specific styling rules on specific elements using the attributes like ID.

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.399
We'll get to that later.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.969
For now, just think about the different ways

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.460
you might use elements to lay out a web page.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.080
Like, what would happen if I moved this down to the bottom?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.400
It shows up there on the browser too, very interesting.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.825
Coming up next, we'll take a deeper dive into the elements that

00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:13.459
HTML provides you with as your structure to build your foundation.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.820
I hope you're as excited as I am because pretty soon,

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.069
you'll be building to the skies digitally at least.
