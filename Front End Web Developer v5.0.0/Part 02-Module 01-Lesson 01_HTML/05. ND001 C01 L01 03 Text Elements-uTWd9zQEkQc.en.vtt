Not everything that's put on the web is text,

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.830
but a lot of it is.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.245
So a lot of the way HTML has been set up it's about using text elements.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.059
But once you start to think about it,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.094
there are so many different kinds of text, right?

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:21.239
Just think about how you use it yourself.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.229
Sometimes you write big bold headlines if you want to catch attention,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.980
sometimes you use bulleted lists if you want to lay out a few things,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.600
sometimes you use numbers,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.414
sometimes you use quotations.

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:36.585
There's all sorts of ways that we can really express ourselves with language and

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:40.859
HTML helps unlock that with some built in element types.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.229
Some examples are an H1 which is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.839
a top level header which is built in to be the biggest boldest texts that you have,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.555
a P element which I've talked about a couple of times.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:58.295
This is the most traditional form of text element, and a div.

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:01.625
A div is the most basic thing you can do.

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:05.075
So lets say that we don't have the kind of text element that you want.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.180
If you don't want a header and you don't want a paragraph tag,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.820
you can use the div HTML element to create your own text element.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.539
How exciting is that?
