Welcome everybody to Intro to HTML.

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.610
In this fabulous course,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.940
we're going to take you through the fundamentals and

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.274
building blocks to create a web page,

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:14.384
and ultimately for you to become your own developer.

00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:19.219
The first step is to learn HTML which will let us lay out our elements,

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:23.250
and then we'll go through some CSS which will allow us to style our elements.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.100
Then will go even further and we'll do some advanced stuff,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.605
so we can create layouts and we can set

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:31.844
each of our elements to be distributed how we want.

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:36.869
This is how we put together the pieces to make a pixel perfect web page,

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:41.304
and you are going to be able to do just that. Let's hop in.

00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:44.450
So to start Intro to HTML,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.145
let's ask the big questions,

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:50.265
like what does HTML stand for?

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:52.155
What is HTML?

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:54.465
Why even learn HTML?

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:58.430
Well, HTML is the basis for all web pages.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.100
Without HTML, you would not be able to organize

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.295
text or add pictures or videos to your web page's.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:10.760
HTML is the start of all you need to understand and build engaging web pages.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.325
Now, what it stands for, get ready.

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:19.129
Hyper Text Markup Language, HTML.

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:23.719
Hyper Text Markup Language. Got that?

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:31.039
You will soon. Hypertext implies that it uses the HTTP portion of internet markup,

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.280
meaning the code you write is annotated with keywords.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.700
These keywords allow the browser to read your code

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.079
and then to produce it as a set of visual experiences for a user.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.349
The fact that HTML ends in

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.464
language implies that it can be read both by a person and a computer.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:54.950
Like any language HTML comes with a set of rules.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.350
So before we get into those rules,

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.688
let's take a little bit of a higher level picture at HTML and say that HTML

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:08.479
is a sequence of tags that tell web browsers how to make or show a web page.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.899
An example of a tag might be a paragraph tag,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.840
which tells the browser that the next data that

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.039
follows should be a paragraph of text shown in the browser.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:24.019
Learning some useful and exceptional HTML tags,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.185
it's a great way to begin constructing your web pages.

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:28.870
So that's just what we're going to do,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.490
we are going to hop in and we're going to look at what

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.700
the elements are that make up this HTML.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:39.064
But lastly, before we do that, why HTML?

00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:41.590
Why would you want to learn HTML?

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.990
Well, HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web apps.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.275
You can put HTML with two other programming languages,

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:58.055
CSS and JavaScript, to create full stack interactive web experiences.

00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:01.310
Those three come together, CSS, JavaScript,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.789
and HTML to create the foundation of the Web
