00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.290
We've seen how to setup a breakpoint and use media queries to

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.980
create different layouts for smaller screens and larger screens.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.554
But there are some development moments that will call for three possible layouts.

00:00:13.554 --> 00:00:18.100
A simple example would be creating two different breakpoints to set it up,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.359
so that X, we'll call the first set of CSS rules,

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.199
X rules apply at the beginning,

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.664
let's say between zero pixels and 900 pixels,

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:31.109
and then we'll set a breakpoint at 900,

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.829
and so Y set of rules apply between 900 and let's say 1150 pixels.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.409
Then anything above 1150 pixels will be set of rules Z,

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.294
which will have its own set of rules.

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:47.450
You could really set up as many media breakpoints as you want but the truth is,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.265
they start to conflict pretty quickly.

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.399
So let's start at two and see if we can get by with that.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.070
So back to the code that we've been looking at,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.030
you can see that we have set up mobile first.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.715
What we want our grid template areas to look like,

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:07.204
at the least wide really screen size.

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:08.420
So in that instance,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.484
we just want one column with all of our content start.

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:15.560
Now, if we come down here,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.079
we see I've set up a media query for what I'm calling medium screens.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.314
Medium screens I'm saying,

00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:29.155
are between a minimum width of 600 pixels,

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:33.739
and now this is new for us a max width of 1100 pixels.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:36.199
Max-width works the same way as min-width,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.790
it sets a boundary.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.859
So what this means is that,

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.959
the min-width of this it's going to have to be 601 pixels,

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.099
and it can't be more than 1100 pixels.

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:52.849
So everything in between this range will reflect

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:57.574
this grid template area which includes an aquamarine border.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:00.545
So let's take a look at that switch first.

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:01.969
If we come over into the browser,

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.004
we can see that we have our column structure here in our tiny screen.

00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:09.109
Once I get it out to 600 pixels,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.850
you can see that it creates a two column structure here.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.064
So this will take me all the way to 1100 pixels.

00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:22.414
But now, I've sent an additional rule for large screens

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:26.949
that says I want it to be setup where the sidebar has more room,

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.864
right here between 600 and 1100.

00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:33.545
Outside bars just going to take up two of these columns.

00:02:33.544 --> 00:02:35.394
But we're saying on a large enough screen,

00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:39.515
we actually want our sidebar to come out and take up four columns.

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:43.519
So if we continue now to bring this across,

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.399
boom did you see that?

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.270
So all the way across here we can see it has a layout that has three rows,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.740
with two columns in the middle row with plenty of room for the blog posts,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.420
maybe too much one could argue.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.064
Then as you come in and the room shrinks,

00:03:07.064 --> 00:03:09.875
these things are going to take up more even space,

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:12.780
but that as we get smaller,

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.804
you can see it I'll just take up one column.

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:20.270
This is an example of how you can use multiple breakpoints to

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.510
set up multiple views using CSS grid.
