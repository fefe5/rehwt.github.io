00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.125
In this lesson, we have covered multi-page layouts with CSS Grid,

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:09.734
responsive layouts with CSS grid,

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:12.269
using media queries and break points,

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.545
as well as nesting grids and making image galleries.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.200
But let's not forget where we began.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.664
All the way back at the fundamentals of HTML.

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:24.929
We learned about HTML elements and

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.964
their tags and the attributes that we can add to those tags.

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:32.594
How we can use those attributes like ID and class

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:36.420
to select those elements for styling with different CSS rules,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.310
like background-color, border, padding, margin.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.770
Then you learned about Flexbox and how to align and distribute content

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.905
easily and elegantly using parent containers.

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:54.649
Then you've learned how to make whole page website designs with CSS Grid and

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.829
Flexbox working seamlessly together which brings us back here to the course recap.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.079
This course is meant to set you up for success throughout the courses that follow.

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.349
So feel free to come back here and review these fundamentals with

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:12.834
me anytime if you start to feel overwhelmed in later lessons.

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:15.899
But don't worry. I know that you've got this.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.015
With HTML and CSS,

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:22.594
you have everything you need for the next steps in your web developer journey.

00:01:22.594 --> 00:01:27.959
Good luck. To infinity and beyond.
