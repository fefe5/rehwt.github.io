It's time to bring it all together.

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:10.004
So far we have learned how CSS grid can help us create layouts for entire web pages,

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:15.585
and how flexbox can be used to style the individual components that make up that layout.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:21.500
Now we're going to sew it altogether into a beautiful and harmonious full web design.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.990
Building layouts with grid is fairly easy once you get the hang of it.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.594
So without further ado,

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:30.549
let's jump into creating layouts with CSS grid.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
