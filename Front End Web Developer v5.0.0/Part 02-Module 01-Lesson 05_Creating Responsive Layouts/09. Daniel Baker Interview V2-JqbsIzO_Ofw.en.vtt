00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.044
Hi. I'm Daniel Silver Baker.

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:05.370
For the first half of my professional career,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.690
I worked with young people doing arts-based health programming in New York.

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.049
I've always been really interested in language, poetry.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.355
I'm a performance poet.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:15.570
In the last five years,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.304
I've extended my language to also include programming.

00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:21.870
So right now, I'm a freelance web developer

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.690
and engineer based out of Los Angeles, California.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.079
I became interested in front-end programming actually working with a group

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.445
of young people on creating a digital program for young people in Brooklyn.

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:42.590
As I was making this program with them,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.285
I started to realize that it might be something that I was falling in love with myself.

00:00:47.284 --> 00:00:49.339
I became one of those self-taught people.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.320
I really just scoured the Internet,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.149
I inspected different pages,

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.859
I tore apart the HTML,

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.859
and eventually I went to NYU,

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.850
where I studied at the Interactive Telecommunications Program.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.000
That's where my love of front-end came into being.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.120
For me, my real interest is in communicating to people.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.680
So front-end web development lets me develop something that you,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.920
the audience, can see as opposed to,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.799
not to say something bad about other kinds of development,

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.060
but programming for computers to talk to each other is for me less

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.840
exciting than when I found front-end programming and I could program for other people.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.179
Getting started in front-end developing can feel difficult.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.030
So my number one thing I would say is patience.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.390
I think patience is such an important part of programming.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.859
This might sound a little up in the air,

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.625
but really to enjoy it as much as you can.

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:50.000
For me my learning has really come from when I can settle in and I

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.635
can give in to the not knowing and then I can find discovery in what I'm doing.

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:57.380
So little wins I think are a big deal.

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:59.589
I tried to set goals for myself.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.420
Turn this box blue by the end of the hour and then I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.310
could work towards that and it feels amazing once you did it.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.090
It really for me as a practice of learning magic.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.099
I think there's mistakes all along the paths being a developer.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.949
So I think the earliest mistakes that people are

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:25.159
prone to make have to do with not trusting yourself.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.014
I think there's an instinct to really copy and paste code at the beginning,

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:32.569
and I really think there's a benefit to instead of doing that,

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.549
to really going through the process yourself.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.340
Writing code from scratch can feel really difficult.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.670
There's nothing scarier than an empty page,

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.799
whether it's coding or poetry or anything else.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.990
But I think there's really something to starting with

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.560
an empty page and creating those elements out from scratch yourself.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.229
At some point, you're going to have to learn to do it yourself.

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.699
So I say throw the crutches out as early as you can.

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.685
For more advanced users,

00:02:56.685 --> 00:02:59.289
I would say not to become too comfortable in what you know.

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:02.840
There's always new ways to do things that are coming out and there's always

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.844
ways to discover what other people are doing to bring it to the next level.

00:03:06.844 --> 00:03:08.000
So for advanced users,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.104
I say push outside your comfort zone.

00:03:10.104 --> 00:03:13.929
For beginning users, I say push outside your comfort zone.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.564
HTML and CSS or what we think of as building block languages.

00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:28.810
So in some ways there are a lot more simple than say JavaScript,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.240
which goes well with them or slightly in another world,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.370
but Python is another advanced programming language.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.615
HTML and CSS though,

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.015
well, we call them basic or easy.

00:03:39.014 --> 00:03:40.454
If you're starting from nothing,

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:41.730
if you've never coded before,

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:45.704
HTML and CSS provide plenty of challenge.

00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:48.765
Those are about what we create.

00:03:48.764 --> 00:03:51.519
The other programming languages like JavaScript then

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.640
allow us to put those things into interaction with each other,

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.959
which can be more complex because it can include equations and math,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.724
about the rates of change, and stuff.

00:04:00.724 --> 00:04:03.424
But really, it's still programming.

00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:07.910
So while I think the hardest thing to do would be going from nothing to say JavaScript,

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.810
by breaking it up, I think it's a good path.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.289
You go from knowing what you know to learning

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:15.454
the more fundamental languages of HTML and CSS.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:19.520
Then I think you'll feel ready for the jump to something like JavaScript.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.789
I know for myself, once I've created,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.145
say a blue circle,

00:04:23.144 --> 00:04:24.909
I want to see my blue circle move,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.100
and that's where something like JavaScript comes in.
