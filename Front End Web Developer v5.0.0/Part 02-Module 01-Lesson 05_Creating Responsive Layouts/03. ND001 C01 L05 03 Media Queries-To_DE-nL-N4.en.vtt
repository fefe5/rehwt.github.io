Media queries are expressions we can add to our code that

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:11.759
modify our website based on characteristics of the device that it's being viewed on.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.009
Okay, quick rewind.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.640
So we're talking about developing apps for the web,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.164
which means we'll write our code and a browser will execute it.

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:25.369
But that browser could be on someone's giant home monitor,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.755
or it could be on a tiny cell phone screen,

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:29.480
or a giant cell phone screen,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.280
or one of the other 135 device sizes in between.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.035
So coding for the web can be difficult

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:40.909
because the different devices will display our content differently.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:46.054
But the awesome flexibility of the web that makes all those things possible is

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:51.350
also funneled into a set of really practical possibilities using media queries.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.945
So how do we ensure elegant design across all the possible different screen sizes?

00:00:56.945 --> 00:01:00.560
We use media queries with breakpoints.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.350
Here you can see a quick example of it.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.224
This is a media query set up with a breakpoint of 900 pixels,

00:01:08.224 --> 00:01:14.063
which means when the browser is more than 900 pixels,

00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:17.599
these are the CSS rules that will take place.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:22.579
Let's take a look at how you would develop first a mobile ready site,

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:28.170
and then have that be able to responsively turn into a big website.
