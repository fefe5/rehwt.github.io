00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.919
We did it. We've covered so much CSS and you're doing great.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.240
We've talked about how CSS selectors, classes, and IDs,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.945
we've discussed inline CSS plus external style sheets,

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:19.829
we've talked about setting CSS rules for different properties like color,

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.244
and border, and so much more.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:24.150
But believe it or not,

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.729
there's even more that can be done with CSS.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.429
I thought I would use this time just to show you a couple additional CSS tips and tricks.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:34.079
So if we look here,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.838
we have our boxes that were used to alphabet beats coincidental drums,

00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:43.574
here are my CSS rules setup for box.

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:46.535
Now, there's a couple of things I want to try here.

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:50.494
One is border radius which has rounded corners.

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:56.929
This is one of my favorite emergent styles in the web development world I'd say.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.070
It's been a couple of years now,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.295
but people are really starting to take advantage of the fact that we don't need

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:04.820
all those rectangles to just be crisp lines.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.974
I think it adds a lot of style to set a little bit depart on a border-radius.

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:11.299
So here's one way.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.575
To do border-radius we can setup with the border-radius name,

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:19.650
and then we could just say 25 Px,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.100
which as you see bend these corners a bit,

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:24.959
but then we lose our words.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.979
So what we can do to ameliorate that is

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.730
to just add a little padding as well with the border-radius.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.219
Now we can see we have our smooth corners and we're not losing our words.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.909
Border-radius can also take percentages.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.234
For example, let's see what happens when we do border-radius 45 percent.

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:50.734
Wow, things got circular.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:53.799
What about 85 percent?

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.265
Cool.

00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:59.780
You can start to see by playing around the different shapes and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.064
setups you can make just using border-radius.

00:02:03.064 --> 00:02:06.259
So what if we wanted instead of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.420
those just those words to have a background image in each of these circles?

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:15.125
That's something we can also do easily with CSS.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.905
So here in the box,

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:25.629
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the background image property which takes URL,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.625
it's the path to the image we want which happens to be the name this time as well.

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:33.590
You can see over here on my folder,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.670
I have the image demo.jpg,

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.169
so here I give it the URL I want,

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.604
and then I'm going to set background size to cover.

00:02:42.604 --> 00:02:45.889
I'll show you in a sec but the background size can do when we change it up.

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.979
But let's take a look at this.

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:51.859
You see now that the image that I have has been placed as

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.590
the background for all of these images including with the border-radius that I set.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.365
So what would happen if I instead of cover tried contained?

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:07.490
Now, you can see what's happened is it has taken the picture and

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.330
it's putting it over multiple times to fill up this space that's there.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.870
Playing with the background size can give you incredible amount of

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.694
detail oriented customization over just how your images and image background look.

00:03:21.694 --> 00:03:23.239
I like this here.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.570
I would like to see the words a tiny bit bigger.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.984
So I might bring it all together and say,

00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:36.500
''That's a great spelling error example like 67 pixels.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.210
Now we're talking.''

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.659
These are just a few more of the things you can do with CSS.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.835
I hope this is opening up your mind,

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:47.450
and focusing your intelligence and your imagination into

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:53.849
all the possibilities that can be created with HTML and CSS. Good luck.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
