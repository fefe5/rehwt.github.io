00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.789
Specificity in CSS.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.160
Specificity is about the way that

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.609
the browser puts different commands above each other, right?

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.910
We've seen examples of how CSS rules can be coming from all over the place.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.490
You might have one rule that's inline,

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.744
and another set of rules that are coming from an external style sheet.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:28.679
One thing might have an ID,

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.434
but it also might have a class.

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:33.420
So you can't have moments where there's clashing style.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.770
So we need our browsers to have a way to deal with this.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.200
We need a hierarchy to tell them.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.710
So the way that it works in CSS is that,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.929
type selectors or what you could think of as the ground level.

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.365
Type selectors are buttons or headers.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:55.700
So these things will have what we consider a generic styling to it.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.210
They're easy to override so that anything that has that

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.835
class selector will override that.

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:08.150
For example, if we have a button that we have said we want the background to be blue,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.000
and we've set that rule using that button type.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.555
But our button also has a class of favorite button.

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:19.470
In favorite button, we've said that the background color should be red,

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.829
the class will take precedence.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.129
So what we'll see is our button will have a background of red.

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:29.584
But what if our button that had a class,

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:31.659
also had an ID,

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.890
and that ID also had CSS attached to it?

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.875
Well, those rules would then overrun the class and type selectors.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.450
So as you can imagine,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.510
it can get a little bit confusing when you have had a lot of rules going on.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.079
So it's really important to keep in mind specificity when you're

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.239
deciding how you want to attach CSS rules to your HTML elements.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:59.254
Now, if you find yourself in a position where you have an element that has a type,

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:01.579
a class, and an ID,

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.500
and you have all these rules coming at you,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.599
and you can't figure out, what's wrong with it?

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.959
Or what's making it look different than you want?

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.469
There is an escape patch of sorts,

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.270
which is the important keyword.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.740
You put an exclamation point,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.284
followed by the word "important" after any specific CSS rule,

00:02:20.284 --> 00:02:24.020
and that will override the hierarchy that's laid out.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.135
Which means, regardless of whether it's the type, class,

00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:32.884
or ID selector, that line of code will take precedence because of the important keyword.

00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:39.215
But, it's one of the most overused things that I see in beginning programming.

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:41.900
Because what the important word allows you to do,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.405
is it allows you to solve one problem immediately,

00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:48.770
but then it creates a stream of problems that keep going.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.939
Because what I find is that,

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.159
often we're using the important keyword,

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.129
when we haven't done the forethought to structure and organize

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.414
our CSS in a way that's going to make sense to us.

00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:00.289
So disguising that problem with

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.215
the important keyword might make you feel better in the moment,

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:06.289
but in the long run, I think it's going to cause you more problems.

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:09.754
So I really urge you to first try to use the type, class,

00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:11.930
and ID selector specificity,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.605
before relying on the important keyword.

00:03:14.604 --> 00:03:22.139
Regardless, I wish you good times in CSS land.
