00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.495
So let's say you have some beautiful HTML written in your

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:13.634
index.html file and you have some CSS set out for your HTML page.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:16.259
The first thing that I would want to know is,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.800
how do I connect specific styling rules to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.045
the individual HTML elements that I want to write CSS for?

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:26.910
That is I want to be able to write rules about

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.629
the style of specific HTML elements I've created.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:34.214
This is where CSS selectors come to the rescue.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:41.315
CSS selectors lets you identify or select specific HTML elements in a number of ways.

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:45.214
The three most popular are by Ids,

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:48.935
by class or by type.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:51.280
So whichever of these three that you use,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.420
the workflow will be the same.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.895
You'll select an element to style,

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:59.660
you'll create an object which I'll show you how to do and then you

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.679
write the CSS rule for that element's property you wish to style.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.915
Let's take a quick look together.

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:11.960
So here you can see that I have a div with the class title,

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:15.214
a paragraph element with the id content,

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:16.689
and a button element.

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.230
Here on our web browser,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.420
you can see that they're all being rendered.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.295
So what would happen if I added a little flair to them?

00:01:24.295 --> 00:01:27.495
So first let's look at the type selector.

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:31.960
The type selector selects specific types of HTML elements.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.559
For example, button, notice that with types we

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.549
don't prepend and either a period or the pound sign,

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.980
instead we just write the name of the type.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.359
So type button and let's say I want my button to

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.370
have a different color background, let say purple.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.910
So here is my button element,

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.269
my button type selector and here's the CSS rule.

00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:00.250
Let's see if it works.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.864
Now, we can see purple button,

00:02:02.864 --> 00:02:04.809
but you know that buttons pretty small.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.435
So let's try to make it a little bigger button,

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:14.284
let's give it a height of a 150 pixels.

00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:16.324
Now, we're getting somewhere.

00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:21.544
It's a little hard to see the color of the text so I can change that to white

00:02:21.544 --> 00:02:27.714
using the color property and let's add some width to it as well.

00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:30.560
Now we have a button being styled.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.319
So in addition to type selector,

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.424
lets take a look at the class selector.

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:39.230
Here we have a div with the class title.

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:45.064
The selector for class uses prepended period before the name.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:47.379
So because this is class title,

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.544
the way that I select it as with a period followed by title.

00:02:51.544 --> 00:02:57.049
So let's make sure it's working and well say since it's our title we want

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.390
the font size to be really big like 54 pixels.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.180
That's interesting because now we see that our P element is also going big.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.974
So let's see if we can change that using the id selector.

00:03:14.974 --> 00:03:20.134
The id selector is prepended with a pound sign like this.

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:26.314
So Pound content is selecting this element with the id content.

00:03:26.314 --> 00:03:34.579
We want this font size to be a little bit smaller, say 27 pixels.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.880
Now we can see that we have set different rules

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.064
for each of our elements using the three different selector types,

00:03:42.064 --> 00:03:44.824
the type selector for the button,

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:52.129
the class selector for our title and the content selector for our paragraph element.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.960
So as I've said before,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.510
it's incredibly important to debug

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:01.519
your code which is something that just came up for me here as I'm doing this with you.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.090
Maybe if you look closely you can see here that for our div with a class of title,

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.115
the opening tag is a div,

00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:13.030
but the closing tag is an h1.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.274
Now, that didn't cause too many problems for us because browsers are incredibly smart,

00:04:19.274 --> 00:04:21.949
but if we had kept going along it would've caused us

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.240
many many problems as we develop a bigger stack of code.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.030
So right now I'm going to easily fix this by just making it a correctly closed div tag.

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:35.989
Selectors allow you a great deal of power in being able to style

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.680
both one specific element or specific types of elements.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.079
As you go through the lesson, you'll experience this.

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:46.469
Now let me stop talking so that you can get to coding. Good luck.
