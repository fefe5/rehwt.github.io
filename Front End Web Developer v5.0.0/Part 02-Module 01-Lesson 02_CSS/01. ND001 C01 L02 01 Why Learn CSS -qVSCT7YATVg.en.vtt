00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.359
So now that we've learned about HTML elements themselves,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.940
let's move into CSS.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.889
So maybe you're asking yourself,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.780
''why do I need to learn CSS? ''

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.529
I mean, I already can create a website,

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:19.259
I can put up inputs and paragraph blocks and image tags.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980
But without CSS, every web page would just be

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.435
a drab set of text and pictures flowing straight into the page.

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:29.934
But with CSS, you can add color,

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:34.189
take control of hundreds of attributes to alter the layout of web pages,

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:37.879
and create visually stunning experiences for your users.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.460
In the real world as a developer,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.399
you'll often be given high fidelity mock ups or

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.039
wire frames that your clients want you to deliver into a website.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.070
Because CSS is the execution of design and

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.689
the design of a web page is the deciding factor in how engaged users are,

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.554
CSS becomes incredibly important in the web marketplace.

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:03.890
So hopefully by the end of this lesson,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.200
you'll understand the basic structure for adding styling to HTML elements,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.424
what the heck's a box model is,

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:14.359
the importance of hierarchy and specificity in CSS,

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.760
how to configure fonts and colors,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.055
styling for images and shapes,

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:21.710
best practices for styling and formatting,

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:24.169
and almost anything else you can imagine.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.114
This is really where we learn how to take what's in our imagination,

00:01:28.114 --> 00:01:31.699
and add the computer code that lets it come to life.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.590
