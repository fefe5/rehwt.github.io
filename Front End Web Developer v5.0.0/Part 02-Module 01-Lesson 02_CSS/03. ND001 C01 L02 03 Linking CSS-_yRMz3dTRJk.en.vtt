00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.190
So we understand how to create some elements with HTML,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.570
and we understand that we can write CSS code to style particular elements.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.830
But how do we actually execute our code in the editor?

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.460
I mean how do we connect the CSS and the HTML?

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.140
Well, you have options.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.070
There are three main ways to link CSS to your HTML code,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.664
and I'll quickly show you an example of

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:28.875
each and then you'll continue learning about them on your own.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:31.589
The first is called inline,

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.469
the second are style tags,

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.829
and the third are external stylesheets.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.449
One way that perhaps you've seen is through linking an external stylesheet.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.249
To link an external stylesheet,

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:50.315
you create a link with a relationship stylesheet,

00:00:50.314 --> 00:00:52.729
a type, text CSS.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.029
Here is our href attribute which you may remember.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.310
Our href attribute goes to styleDemo.css So

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.004
let's go into our folder and we see here we have styleDemo.css.

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.359
So one way that we could do this,

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:14.340
is we could say here we have an ID test. So there's one way.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.939
We can use an external stylesheet here,

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.069
which we've linked in head of our HTML document,

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.849
and then it reads perfectly to this.

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:29.869
A second way is called inline CSS.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.570
Inline CSS lets you actually add the CSS code as an attribute,

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.224
in the front tack of a div.

00:01:38.224 --> 00:01:40.919
So for example, here we have our div,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.900
and as we learned in HTML we have an ID attribute,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.420
but we can also have a style attribute.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.644
Here the style attribute lets you write CSS rules directly onto a div.

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:57.299
So right now this div has style font size 54 px,

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.259
but if we change it to style font size 14 px,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.085
we see a shrink right down.

00:02:04.084 --> 00:02:07.174
So see that these also work in connection.

00:02:07.174 --> 00:02:09.574
I'm calling both this CSS,

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:11.344
which is giving me the color red,

00:02:11.344 --> 00:02:16.115
and on an inline style I'm setting the font to be 14 points.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:17.570
But that's not it.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.229
There's a third way you can do this which are to put

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:25.729
style tags directly inside your header.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.859
So notice in our header here,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.470
we've linked an external style sheet.

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.330
But if we don't want to do that,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.585
we could put style tags directly in here and then

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:40.280
any CSS we write will go directly into our HTML.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.229
So let's do this.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:46.924
Let's say text-decoration uppercase.

00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:48.110
I think this is a property,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.595
we'll find out together.

00:02:49.594 --> 00:02:52.955
It's going to be text transform I think actually.

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:56.150
Then we see uppercase.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.870
So now, we have CSS coming from an external sheet,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.235
we have CSS that's coming from within style tags in the header,

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:11.305
and we have inline CSS directly on the element.

00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:13.855
Now, to be clear in the real world,

00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:17.599
I think you would rarely use all three of these in one project.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.530
For different instances, you might use one or the other.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.680
Often the style tags are good when you're just trying to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.875
throw something together and you don't want to have two files yet.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:31.009
But ultimately, when you're working on a professional project,

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.370
we talk about separating concerns.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.825
So it's going to be helpful for you to know how to have your CSS in a separate file.

00:03:38.824 --> 00:03:40.769
But while we're going along in this lesson,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.670
you'll often see me use these style tags in the header because

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.729
they work just fine and they're great for demonstration.

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.489
You can choose your own way to put it in CSS.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.070
It's really up to the imagination.
