Welcome to Debugging CSS.

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:09.330
We all knew we'd end up here because just like with HTML,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.975
debugging CSS takes such a great deal of patience,

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:14.235
such a good eye,

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:17.280
and it's one of the most important parts of coding.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.840
CSS errors can be hard to notice because the browser will often go ahead and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.505
render your code just without it being displayed in the way that you want.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:30.700
Incorrect CSS can lead to problems throughout your code base,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.600
so it's incredibly important that you isolate and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.005
look for problems before you build bigger websites.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:42.605
So let's take a quick look together at some of the most common CSS bugs.

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:44.105
As a quick reminder,

00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:47.810
bugs are what we consider issues in our code.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.720
So anything that's an error or anything that's causing

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.215
behavior other than what's expected it's called a bug.

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:57.050
So debugging then is the process of going through

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.929
our code to find those places where the errors are,

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.920
removing those bugs so that everything can rock on.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.840
So here I have set up some CSS code that has some of the most common errors.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.610
Take a look before I talk about it just to see if you can see any with your eye.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.330
So here in the box class,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.954
you'll see that I'm missing a colon between

00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:31.610
the position which is the property and the value which is absolute.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.995
It's always important to make sure that the syntax is property, colon, value, semicolon.

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:47.075
Now, here in the ID 1 I'm missing a semicolon after the color red.

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:48.860
This line looks good.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.660
This line looks good.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.225
Something's funny here.

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:57.570
I've misspelled or misnamed a property,

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.680
which is one of the things that happens all the time,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.810
because it's not always intuitive what you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.435
want something to do verse what it actually is.

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:10.850
So while the index is what I'm going for the way that CSS understands the index,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.270
is the hyphen index.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.515
It's these little errors that can make debugging a little difficult.

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:24.500
So here you'll see the issue is that this two is not prep

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.860
ended with either the class or ID sign of a period or a hash.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.620
So it's supposed to be a type,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.320
but HTML doesn't have a type called two,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.030
it has a list,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.860
it has an image, a button,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.120
input, a text area,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.470
it has all sorts of things,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.600
but two is nothing.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.005
If I wanted it to be the ID 2 I could do that,

00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:50.870
if I wanted it to be the Class 2, I could do that.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.345
But two on it's own will do nothing.

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:57.340
Three on the other hand is the perfectly valid ID,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.230
and this perfectly valid ID wants to have a background of blue, but in fact,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.310
I have misspelled it so that it has a background of bluue,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.160
which is nothing unfortunately because

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.890
B-L-U-U-E is not a color that the browser will recognize blue.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.625
This is an example of how you would debug CSS.

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:22.110
Now, good luck on your own.
