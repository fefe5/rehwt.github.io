00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.379
The box model.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.160
Doesn't it seem like everything comes in boxes with the web?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.330
The box model is the foundation of layout on the web,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.220
it's the conceptual model that code and browsers

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.714
follow to visualize the content of a webpage.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:19.129
At the highest level,

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:24.299
the box model represents every HTML element in a rectangular box,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.950
and this box has a number of properties that decide how it's displayed.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.964
Every element you make uses the box model,

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.679
and each element will be given a width,

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.034
a height, a margin,

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:39.509
a border, and padding.

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:44.119
Now, width and height are probably familiar and self-explanatory,

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:47.419
but for the other properties associated with the box model,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.179
let's take a quick look at some code in the browser to get

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.560
a better idea of what we're talking about in action.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.640
So here, I'm going to start by creating an element.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.380
I'll say div class equals box.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.275
Let's make sure it's up. It is,

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.960
and then let's add some style.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:14.629
So let's say our box has a width of 300 pixels,

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:18.259
a height of 500 pixels.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.109
Let's say it has a border,

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.189
so we can see of 2px solid.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.519
This is a grade that I like.

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:30.359
Now that we could see, we have our box.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.099
Now, I'm just going to create a second box

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:37.804
because one of the things I want us to look at

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:41.270
is the margin and padding that comes with these.

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:42.964
So here we can see our elements,

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:44.915
box 1, box 2.

00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:48.699
Here, we could see the element size,

00:01:48.698 --> 00:01:50.265
we could see the padding,

00:01:50.265 --> 00:01:52.430
the border, and the margin.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.730
So let's try adding some margin explicitly,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.710
and you could see that the margin is one of the things that will set our boxes apart.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:09.055
So now, we can see that our box has the blue matches up to here,

00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:12.580
300 by 500, and the margin,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.905
we could see here in orange.

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:18.490
So let's add some padding just to see what the padding does too.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.540
So now, we can see the blue represents the width and the height,

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:30.734
we could see the green is the padding and the orange is the margin of our elements.

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:32.775
Because these are both class box,

00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:35.365
we could see that they're set to be the same.

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:37.465
Now, if we wanted to override it,

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:40.045
remember, we can always use inline styles.

00:02:40.044 --> 00:02:42.189
So maybe on my second box,

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.009
I want to say style attribute equals,

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.699
and I actually want to give it

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:58.269
a border that's red inline styles, border that's red.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.335
Now, we could see we have the blue Python width, green padding.

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:06.370
We could see our slight border,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.390
and then we see our margin.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.774
This is the box model, quite literally,

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:15.520
boxes inside of boxes. Sound good?
