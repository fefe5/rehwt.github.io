  <h3></h3>
  <div>
  <h1 id="development-strategy">Development Strategy</h1>
<p>It's very important that you <em>plan your project</em> before you start writing any code! Break your project down into <em>small</em> pieces of work and strategize your approach to each one. With these bite-sized amounts, it'll be easier to debug and fix any issues that appear.</p>
<p>Feel free to implement your own design workflow, but if you get stuck -- here is a walkthrough to get you up and running!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start by duplicating your project 3 weather app.</strong> Once duplicated, change the new project’s name to make certain you're not overwriting your old project. We are going to build off this project as a foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Get webpack set up to work with this project.</strong> Use the skills you learned in project 4 to get your development environment going. <ul>
<li>Create your <code>src</code> folder first. The <code>src</code> folder should contain a client folder and a server folder. </li>
<li>Your server folder should contain your <code>server.js</code> content. </li>
<li>Your client folder should contain a <code>js</code> folder, <code>media</code> folder, <code>styles</code> folder, and <code>views</code> folder, as well as an <code>index.js</code> file.</li>
<li>Your application js should go into the <code>js</code> file, your css into <code>styles</code>, and your <code>index.html</code> into <code>views</code>. </li>
<li>Convert your stylesheet from a <code>.css</code> file to a <code>.scss</code> file</li>
<li>Remember that webpack builds a <code>dist</code> file. You’ll need to update your server js to access the <code>dist</code> folder. (Hint: <code>app.use(express.what goes here?)</code>)</li>
<li>Your <code>index.js</code> file inside the client folder should import the main function of your application javascript, it should import your scss, and it should export your main function from your application javascript. But in order to import, where will you need to export it?</li>
<li>In project 4, you may have added your event listeners to the buttons themselves. For this project, you should be using <code>.addEventListener()</code>; If we are exporting functions from our <code>application.js</code> file, our event listeners can’t go there. Where can we put them? To call that exported function?</li>
<li>Now that your src folder is set up, it’s time to get webpack going. You should already have a few dependencies installed from project 3. We need to add babel, babel loader, css loader, file loader, html loader, html webpack plugin, node sass, sass loader, style loader, webpack, webpack cli, and webpack dev server. Refer to your project 4 to see what’s there, most of these should have been in use there. </li>
<li>Next, update the scripts in <code>package.json</code>. You will want to have <code>test</code>, <code>dev</code>, <code>start</code>, and <code>build</code>. <br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Start will be for your express server, dev will be so that you can take advantage of web dev server. It is possible depending on your setup to run both of these with one command. </li>
<li>Get your webpack config set up. Should be fairly similar to your language processing app webpack config. If you did not use webpack dev server in your language processing app, you will want to do so here. Additionally, using source maps will help you debug your css. </li>
<li>To get webpack running, you’ll want to first run <code>npm run dev</code>, then <code>npm build</code> to get your <code>dist</code> folder created. Once that is created you can run <code>npm run dev</code> and <code>npm start</code> simultaneously to have hot loading of your project as well as a working express environment. <br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If needed, reference the stripped-down version of project 3 with webpack in the starter documentation.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Create an account with <a href="http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Geonames</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Replace the openweather api with geonames api.</strong> You already have one working api. What information needs to get adjusted so that instead of entering a zip code, you enter a city? We want to get the latitude, longitude, country, instead of getting the temperature, feeling, and date.<ul>
<li>The weather data array was named differently, what do we need to change the name to?</li>
<li>The weather data only had 1 object in the array, the geoname api outputs multiple objects. How do we call the first object?</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Introduce a countdown.</strong> You’ll need to add a text field to your project to get the date.<ul>
<li>What type of input should it be? What about cross browser rendering?</li>
<li>We’re looking to see how soon the trip is, how can you get the information from the DOM and see how soon that date is?</li>
<li>Where should you be storing that data once you have it? </li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Create an account with <a href="https://www.weatherbit.io/account/create" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Weatherbit</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Integrate the Weatherbit API similarly to how you integrated the geoname api.</strong> What information needs to get adjusted for you to pull in the future weather? Getting a CORS error? Check out <a href="https://medium.com/@dtkatz/3-ways-to-fix-the-cors-error-and-how-access-control-allow-origin-works-d97d55946d9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this article</a> for some options. 
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you see that your app is working, but it takes several clicks to get all of the data, think of why this could be. This is possibly the most challenging part of the project. There is a major hint located in the <em>Before you Begin</em> section. If you’re unable to figure it out, and your app still works with a few clicks, continue working on it, it may come to you later, or you’ll get guidance from your reviewer when you submit the app. <ul>
<li>How does the Weatherbit API distinguish from the current forecast and future forecasts? Does the API change in any way? <em>Hint: please refer to Weatherbit <a href="https://www.weatherbit.io/api" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">API documentation</a> - Current Weather API and Forecast API</em></li>
<li>How will we include the date? What format does it need to be in? How can we change it to the appropriate format? </li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Create an account with <a href="https://pixabay.com/api/docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pixabay</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Integrate the Pixabay API similarly to how you integrated the Geoname/Weatherbit APIs.</strong> What information are you going to submit to the API to achieve an appropriate image? What if there are no results?<ul>
<li>What Parameters will you want to set to pull in images?</li>
<li>How will you submit your data from the location field to a Pixabay URL parameter without having spaces in the url?</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Choose one of the items from the suggested list to add in.</strong> The items vary in complexity, but you must choose at least 1, all others are optional. </li>
<li><strong>REFACTOR.</strong> At this point, your code should be working properly. Ideally, refactoring happens while you are developing, but as a new developer, you often don’t have the whole picture in your head to be able to do so properly.  Let’s clean the project up. <ul>
<li>Have you run your code through a linter? We request you still follow Udacity standards when the code is complete, but running it through an <a href="https://eslint.org/demo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eslinter</a> is going to help you get started in refactoring. </li>
<li>Are you using ES6 const and let? </li>
<li>Are all your functions using ES6 arrow functions?</li>
<li>Is your code DRY? Are there any pieces that would be better served as a helper function to avoid duplication?</li>
<li>How is your code structured? Have you created functions for the main functionality with properly scoped variables? Starting out it’s likely that you will have a globally scoped variables on occasion until you learn more about closures and design patterns. But placing your code into functions is a great way to make your code more readable and a way to avoid globally scoped variables. </li>
<li>Are your project files named in a way that makes sense? </li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Add in services workers.</strong> Refer to project 4 for guidance. </li>
</ol>

  <h2 id="extend-your-project-further----roadmapstrategy">Extend your Project Further -  Roadmap/Strategy</h2>
<p>You'l need to implement <em>at least one</em> of the below in the project. If you’re going to do any of the suggested tasks, it’s recommended that you hold off on service workers until you are closer to submitting. This is a good use for comments. </p>
<ul>
<li>Add end date and display length of trip. </li>
<li>Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities). </li>
<li>Allow user to add multiple destinations on the same trip.<ul>
<li>Pull in weather for additional locations.</li></ul></li>
<li>Allow the user to add hotel and/or flight data.<ul>
<li>Multiple places to stay? Multiple flights?</li></ul></li>
<li>Integrate the <a href="https://restcountries.eu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">REST Countries API</a> to pull in data for the country being visited. </li>
<li>Allow the user to remove the trip.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-local-storage-with-javascript/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Local Storage</a> to save the data so that when they close, then revisit the page, their information is still there. </li>
<li>Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.</li>
<li>Incorporate icons into forecast.</li>
<li>Allow user to Print their trip and/or export to PDF.</li>
<li>Allow the user to add a todo list and/or packing list for their trip.</li>
<li>Allow the user to add additional trips (this may take some heavy reworking, but is worth the challenge). <ul>
<li>Automatically sort additional trips by countdown.</li>
<li>Move expired trips to bottom/have their style change so it’s clear it’s expired.</li></ul></li>
