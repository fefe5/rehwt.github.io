00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.129
Congratulations on taking this step toward becoming a front end web developer.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:06.900
My name is David Harris.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.820
I'm a Product Lead here at Udacity.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.375
I'm so excited for you to begin this Nano degree program.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:15.849
It's been nearly 30 years since the birth of the World Wide Web,

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.384
and there's never been a more exciting time to be a front end web developer.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:24.900
Today, more than 4 billion people use the internet for communication,

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.494
commerce, entertainment, and learning.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:31.844
Front end web developers make all of these incredible experiences possible,

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:35.475
by creating and programming the websites that connect the whole world.

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:37.850
Throughout this Nano degree program you'll create

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.375
five websites using the latest technology in web development.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.859
You'll build your own blog,

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.479
a product marketing site,

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.114
an online weather journal,

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:47.645
a sentiment analysis app,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:49.250
and a travel planning site.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.840
Over the next few months,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.600
you'll be sharpening your skills as a web developer,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.520
and you'll come out on the other side with

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.390
a portfolio of front end web development projects you'll be proud of.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.570
Welcome to Udacity, I think you're going to like it here.
