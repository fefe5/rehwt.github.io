00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Way to go. You just finished course 4.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.919
We've come a long way,

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.849
and you've learned about build tools and the role they play in front-end development,

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.564
Webbpack and all of its core concepts,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:14.714
the difference between production and development builds,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:18.990
SAS for better styling and service workers for extended functionality.

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.570
Now that you've learned all these skills,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.100
you're ready to take on bigger and better challenges with your front end. Good luck.
