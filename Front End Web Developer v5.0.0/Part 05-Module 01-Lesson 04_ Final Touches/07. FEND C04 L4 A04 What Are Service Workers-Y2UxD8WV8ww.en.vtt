00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
In this section, we're going to highlight

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.189
one last really cool thing that we can do with Webbpack.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.975
We're going to add service workers.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:11.849
Service workers is a piece of JavaScript that runs between our app and the Internet,

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.434
and runs in the background to allow us to do some really cool things

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:19.560
like push notifications or even offline content.

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:21.809
You'll often hear about service workers,

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:24.719
talked about in the same circles as progressive web apps.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:30.035
Progressive web apps are essentially websites that can feel more like a mobile phone app.

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:31.940
Now, as an introduction to

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.914
all the really cool things that you can do with service workers,

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:37.460
we're going to take the app we've built and use

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.460
service workers to make our content available offline.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.770
You can use service workers without Webbpack,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.215
but Webbpack makes it wonderfully easy,

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:47.280
and I'm sure you'll see how.
