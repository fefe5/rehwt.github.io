00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.480
Now you have learned to think inside the Flexbox,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.160
using the box model.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.730
With so many boxes there's so much to store.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.179
In this lesson, we learned how the display property, Flex,

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.850
on a container element can be used to control

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.255
the distribution and alignment of elements inside of it.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:26.879
We learned to control the flex flow with flex direction column or row.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:31.934
We learned how to justify and align content along the main and cross axes.

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:35.250
We also learned how a flex container can expand to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.924
fit the items inside of it and to prevent overflow.

00:00:38.924 --> 00:00:42.015
Unlike many other CSS properties,

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:47.840
Flex has a main container and then inside of it it has elements that we call items.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.325
Some CSS Flex properties are used only on the parent and others are used on the items.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:58.430
Now, I wish you great luck using Flexbox in the wild.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.289
It's one of those things that I think now that you have learned it,

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.245
you'll start to recognize it at a lot of the different developing places you go.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:08.359
Flex is constantly used for web development and it's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.480
well worth your time to learn how you can align,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.300
distribute, and set up a set of elements just in the way that you want. Good luck.
