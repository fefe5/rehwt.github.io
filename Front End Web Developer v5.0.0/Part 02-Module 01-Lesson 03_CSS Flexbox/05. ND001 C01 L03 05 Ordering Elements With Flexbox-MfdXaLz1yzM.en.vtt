00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:05.804
Another great tool that Flexbox allows you,

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:09.330
is there are several ways for you to dynamically order

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.905
the items inside your parent container using Flexbox code.

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:19.064
The three ways that we're going to look at today are row reverse and column reverse.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:24.164
Here we see that keyword reverse which can be used on the Flex direction setting.

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:28.085
The second way is the specific order of the HTML code.

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:31.700
You can actually move the lines of code that you want to create the order.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.030
The third is the order CSS property.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.439
The order CSS property is specifically for Flex items.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:46.104
That is HTML elements that are inside of another HTML element that has the display Flex.

00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:47.904
That's the Flex container,

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:49.880
inside it are the flex items.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.925
Flex items have a CSS property called

00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:56.974
order that can set the order that they appear in your browser.

00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:02.969
Let's take a quick look at how these three different ones might happen.
