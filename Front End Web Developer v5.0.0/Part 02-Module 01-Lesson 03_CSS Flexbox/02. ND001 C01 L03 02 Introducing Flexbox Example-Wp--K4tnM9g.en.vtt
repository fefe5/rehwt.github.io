00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
Let's take a quick look at some of the key things that Flexbox can do.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.589
I'm going to do that without giving too much explanation,

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.859
just because I want to give you an idea of what Flexbox is.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:15.224
Then step-by-step, we'll go through and teach how to do each of them.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:19.035
Here, you can see that I have set up.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.585
Let's take a look at the HTML first,

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:24.585
a div with a class container,

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.234
and then inside of that,

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.384
I have three divs with the class box,

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.245
and each of them has a different ID,

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:32.895
one, two, and three.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:38.984
So one thing I could do is simply change my flex direction from column to row,

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:43.729
and you see that it has changed the alignment of the boxes inside.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.049
So now if you look,

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:47.750
you can see that my three boxes are in a row.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.009
But again, column and they are in a column.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.604
What about column reverse?

00:00:55.604 --> 00:00:57.179
So here it's box one,

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.024
box two, box three.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:01.814
Now, that we refreshed it's box three,

00:01:01.814 --> 00:01:04.069
box two, box one.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.729
Let's go back to a row for a second.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.880
Let's try changing how we justify our content.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.204
You can see that each of the three boxes

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:19.204
also have some of their own individual CSS properties.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:22.834
The one that I want us to look at right this second is just called order.

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:25.609
Right now they all have an order of one.

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.030
So there are ordered one, two, three.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.180
But watch what happens when I drop the order of one and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.780
two to three and leave the order property of div three at one.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.349
You see that box three is now first because it comes in

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:47.854
the order or of columns like this.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:49.790
If we don't want to align in the item center,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.035
we move them over there.

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:55.854
There's all stuff that you can do once you start to take control with Flexbox.

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:59.659
Let's dive deeper so that you can learn the real skills underlying

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.980
the movements we're making and set up your pixel perfect website.
