Now we're going to cover my favorite part of flexbox,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.429
or at least it's what brought me to flexbox.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.054
I was constantly struggling with how to align and justify items on my web page.

00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:19.109
I would have a parent element that would have between three and 12 elements inside of it,

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.210
and I would drive myself crazy trying to set

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.685
absolute positioning or relative positioning,

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:26.474
trying to get all the things aligned how I want.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.355
Then I came across flexbox,

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:32.810
and being able to align and justify the items in relationship to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.785
each other with simple CSS properties is a game changer.

00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:40.159
The two key properties we're going to talk about here are;

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.489
align items and justify content.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.890
Let's take a look at them in action.
