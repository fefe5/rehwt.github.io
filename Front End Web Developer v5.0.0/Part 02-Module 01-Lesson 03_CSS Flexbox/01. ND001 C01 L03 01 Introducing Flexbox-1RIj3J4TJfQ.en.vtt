00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:05.195
Introducing Flexbox.

00:00:05.195 --> 00:00:07.630
Now it's when I think we're entering

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.115
the intermediate skill level range of our work together.

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:16.304
Flexbox, the flexible box module,

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:20.274
but everyone pretty much just called Flexbox specializes in

00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:24.564
aligning and distributing elements within a parent element.

00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:27.234
Alignment and justification can be made

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:30.294
pretty easy with software such as Adobe Illustrator.

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:34.030
But until Flexbox, it was relatively difficult to distribute and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.899
align elements in a visually appealing way with just code.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.119
Flexbox comes around and brings a few things with it.

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:48.844
A flex container can expand to fit the items available inside of it.

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:52.854
A flex container unlike other CSS properties

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:57.044
uses the main container with items then nested inside of it,

00:00:57.045 --> 00:01:03.079
and some of the CSS properties are used only for the parent and others on the items.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.769
The terminology we will be using is container for

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.594
the parent element and items for the elements inside of it.

00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:13.039
You think flex it's actually super easy.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.470
We just set the display property of an element to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.414
flex and you can start using all the associated keywords.

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:23.190
