00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.390
Two of the major concepts involved in Flexbox or the axis and the direction.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.470
The Flexbox model relies on two axis.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.069
The main axis is defined by flex direction which has four possible values: row,

00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:23.039
row reverse, column, and column reverse.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.454
The two row settings will create the main access horizontally or

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:31.289
inline while the two column settings will create

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.325
the main access vertically or block direction.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:42.285
This means that whichever access is not the main access will be our alternate access.

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:45.079
The axis determined the flow of your content.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.604
You can think of this as being either rows or columns,

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:51.769
and they will be determinant when you start aligning and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.100
justifying content within a flex container.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.350
Now that we've talked about axis and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.010
direction as well as looking at the row and column settings,

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.250
let's combine it all and take a quick look together and see if we can

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.239
understand exactly what's going on with these directions and these different axis.
