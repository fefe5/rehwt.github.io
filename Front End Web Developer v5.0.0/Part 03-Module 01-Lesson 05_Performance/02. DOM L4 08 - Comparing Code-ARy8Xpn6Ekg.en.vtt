00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
On the left side, this is the code that were used to.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.844
We creative a div,

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:06.565
create 200 paragraph elements,

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:07.990
add those elements to the div.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.990
And then once we've created 200,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.269
we add that div to the page.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.209
Over here we run a loop 200 times and each

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.990
time through the loop it creates a paragraph element and adds it to the page.

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.820
Now each one of these pieces of code has

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.355
the performance at the beginning, so it takes a check.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.140
And then down here at the end,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.935
it takes a new check of the performance and then subtracts it

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:30.750
to give us the total amount of time it took to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.134
run this piece of code or this piece of code.

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:36.244
So let's run them and see what it tells us.

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:39.169
So we can see that this one over here is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.210
about half a millisecond and this one is

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.448
over here is about three quarters of a millisecond.

00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:45.049
So this one runs quite a bit faster.
