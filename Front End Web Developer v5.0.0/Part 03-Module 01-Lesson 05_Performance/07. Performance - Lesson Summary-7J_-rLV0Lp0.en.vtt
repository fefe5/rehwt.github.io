00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
Both the code, you write and how it

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.459
performs are vital things to think about while you are developing.

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.330
In this lesson, we looked at how to measure the speed of

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.140
the code we write and how to write it in an efficient way.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.039
We also looked at how "reflow" and "repaint" affect performance.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.494
Lastly, we looked at the Javascript Event Loop that powers all javascript engines,

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:26.000
knowing how the Event Loop works will enable you to write quality code.
