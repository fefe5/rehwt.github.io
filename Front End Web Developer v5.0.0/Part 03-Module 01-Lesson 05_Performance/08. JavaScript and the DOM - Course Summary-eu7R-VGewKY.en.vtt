00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
You've made it to the end.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.665
Congratulations!

00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:05.830
Can you believe how far you've come?

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.085
You've worked really hard and acquired many impressive skills,

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:11.350
but it still might feel hard to explain

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.644
everything you've learned to friends or employers.

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:17.634
So let me list what you've accomplished since the beginning of this course.

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:20.665
You've learned what the DOM is and how it's constructed.

00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:23.399
You've learned how to create content with JavaScript.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.544
You've learned about browser events and how to respond to them.

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:28.420
And you learned how to write better,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.890
more performant code. Amazing work.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, this actually isn't the end, though.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.240
You have the necessary knowledge to manipulate a web page,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.980
but to truly become great at it,

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:40.875
you need to practice.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:45.384
So build a bunch of projects to use DOM methods and interact with browser events.

00:00:45.384 --> 00:00:48.640
Put these projects online and share them with others.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.005
Thanks for working through this course with me,

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.000
and congratulations on your accomplishments. See you later.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
