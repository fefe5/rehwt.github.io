This is not a course on performance,

00:00:02.444 --> 00:00:05.161
but it's never too early to talk about performance.

00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:08.900
In this lesson, you'll learn how to measure the speed of your code,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.480
how to write efficient and performing code,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.769
and you'll learn all about

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.000
the JavaScript event loop and how it affects the code you write.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
